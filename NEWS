Version 0.3:

* General:

** Added NLS support. Currently Catalan and Spanish translations
are available.

** Fixed compilation with the newer versions of Berkeley DB.

* libmailbox:

** Functions for generating References: and In-Reply-To: headers as
per RFC 2822.

** A set of functions for sequential access to streams.

** The function mu_errstring is renamed to mu_strerror for consistency
with the usual practice.

** Added initial implementation of message header encoding and decoding
functions (RFC 2047).

* libsieve:

** The syntax of multiline strings is extended. It is possible
to use arbitrary ending delimiter instead of the default dot,
and to strip off the leading tabs, which allows for natural
indentation of the multiline strings.

** Added support for relational tests according to RFC 3431.

** Fixed incorrect handling of multiple addresses in `address'
tests.

* imap4d:

** The untagged output was fixed to conform to the RFC 2060. Specifically,
the output of STORE command is corrected in accordance with the
rfc2060-errata document; the EXIST and RECENT untagged are always
returned by EXAMINE, SELECT, and NOOP.

** Added support for TLS and GSASL.

** Implemented LOGINDISABLED capability.

** Implemented IDLE command (RFC 2177).

* pop3d: Added TLS support.

* mail: Fixed error diagnostics and removed startup banner.

* mh: Initial implementation. 


Version 0.2:

* libmailbox: Several bugfixes. The configuration suite allows
  to disable support for any protocol or mailbox format to reduce
  the size of the library.

* Added new utility mailutils-config. This utility prints gcc command
  line options needed for compiling and linknig an application against
  mailutils.

* libsieve: New library. Supports Sieve language as described in
  RFC 3028 and provides a mechanism for dynamic loading of
  user-defined actions, tests and comparators.

* sieve: Completely rewritten using libsieve.

* sieve.scm: Added vacation extension action.

* mail.local: Allows to apply user-defined sieve filters before delivering
  messages.

* mail utility: Added `editheaders' boolean variable. When set, the
  user is allowed to edit headers of the message.
  Message set specification allows negation of search primitives, e.g.
  `from ! subject:/daily/' outputs all messages whose subject
  does not contain the word 'daily'.
  Reply command correctly adds `In-Reply-To' and `References' headers
  to outgoing messages.
  When used with a numeric argument '=' command sets the current
  message to this number.
  New command `setenv' allows to set and examine environment
  variables.
  The semantics of `crt' variable is made compatible with that of
  other implementations.
  Fixed several bugs.

* libmu_scm: Added support for Guile 1.7.0
