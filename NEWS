Please send mailutils bug reports to <bug-mailutils@gnu.org>.

Version 0.6.94:

* Add support for Berkeley DB 3.x and 4.x
See the description of --with-berkeley-db option in the README file.

* Add support for Guile 1.8.x

* The module mailutils.scm is now defined as (mailutils mailutils). Please
change your (use-modules) statements accordingly.

* Scheme modules can now be installed in the site-wide Guile directory.
See the description of --with-guiledir option in the README file.

* Bugfixes:
** Fix handling of file names containing whitespace characters in imap4 server
and library.
** frm: Fix coredump on empty From headers
** folder: If a +folder is given along with the -all switch, folder will, in
addition to setting the current folder, list the top-level subfolders
for the current folder (with -norecurse) or list all sub-folders under
the current folder recursively (with -recurse). This behavior is
compatible with nmh and rand implementations.
** all mh utilities: create nested directories, if required.


Version 0.6.93:

* The library namespace is optimized. Now all global identifiers begin 
with mu_.
NOTE: This is incompatible change.

Programs using old API can still be compiled, using one of the
following approaches. If the program includes <mailutils/mailutils.h>,
define the symbol MU_COMPAT before including it (or invoke cc with
-DMU_COMPAT option). Othervise, include file <mailutils/compat.h>.

* Main library is renamed to libmailutils
NOTE: This is incompatible change, unless you use mailutils-config to
obtain loader options (which is recommended, anyway).

* Use of '~' character (denoting the user home directory)

This character is expanded also if it appears after the protocol
specification in a mailbox URL. e.g.: maildir:~/Mail/inbox.

It is possible to use '~' in mailutils configuration file.

* New option --mailbox-type

Use this option to specify the default mailbox type. It is supported
by all utilities that use "mailbox" command line capability (see the
documentation for the list). For example:

  mail --mailbox-type=mh: --file=~/Mail/inbox

will open ~/Mail/inbox directory as an MH folder. This option is
especially useful in the mailutils configuration file. For example,
adding this line to your mailutils.rc:

:mailbox  --mailbox-type=mh:

will force all mail utilities to use MH by default.

* mail: New option --exec (-E) allows to execute arbitrary mail commands
before opening the mailbox. Any number of --exec options can be given.

** New variables `recursivealiases' and `inplacealiases' control the way
mail aliases are expanded. When `recursivealiases' is set, aliases
will be expanded recursively. When `inplacealiases' is set, alias
expansion takes place before entering compose mode (by default, it is
carried out when exiting compose mode, right before sending the
message). The default is `set recursivealiases noinplacealiases'.

* imap4d: New option --create-home-dir: If a user logs in and his home
directory does not exist, create it.

* Changes in MH

** Context file handling

Comments and empty lines are allowed in any MH context file
(.mh_profile, .mtstailor etc.)

Comment is any line whose first non-whitespace character is
'#'. Notice that '#' looses its special meaning when used as a part of
the keyword or a value. 

** send

Add support for localname and localdomain mtstailor variables.

New mtstailor variable x-mailer controls whether to add the 'X-Mailer'
header to the message being sent, if it does not contain one. The
value 'yes' means to add the default X-Mailer string, the value
'no' means to ignore it. Any other value is taken as the X-Mailer
identifier to be added to the message.

** mhn

In compose mode mhn analyzes Subject: line and, if it contains any
non-printable characters, encodes it in accordance with RFC
2047. Encoding type and charset are taken from the first message
part. They also can be specified in the subject itself using the
following syntax:

 #<encoding=ENC; charset=CSET>CONTENT

* Bugfixes:
** mail: Fix handling of conditional expressions
** mail: When several recipients were specified, no alias expansion took
place. 
** movemail: did not preserve input mailbox if an I/O error happened on the
output one. Debian Bug#344420.
** Fix handling of Alternate-Mailboxes in MH


Version 0.6.91:

* libsieve: New action 'vacation'

* imap4d: Implemented SASL authentication using LOGIN and PLAIN mechanisms.

* Plaintext passwords for SASL authentication types can be kept in SQL
database. When used with LOGIN or PLAIN, the passwords may be
encrypted using MySQL password() function. New option
--sql-password-type specifies what kind of password is returned by
--sql-getpass query. Its possible values are: `plain' for plaintext
passwords, `scrambled' for passwords hashed using MySQL algorithm and
`hash' for MD5 or DES hashed passwords (default).

* mail

** Improved output of the commands `headers' and `z'

** Improved POSIX compatibility.
In particular, `next' command now works as described by
POSIX. Following commands change the status of the message to `read':
mbox, pipe, print, top, undelete, visual and decode (a GNU extension).
Implemented following variables: flipr, showto, bang.
The command `touch' does not alter messages that were deleted or saved
to a file.

** The `decode' command uses `mailcap' extension to display
parts of MIME multy-part messages. By default the built-in mailcap
engine is used. Normally `mail' asks for confirmation before running
an interpreter to display a message part, unless the type of the part
is listed in `mimenoask' mail variable.

If `metamail' variable is set, it specifies the external program
to be used instead of the built-in engine. Thus, settting

      set metamail="metamail -m mail -p"

in your ~/.mailrc enables use of the standard `metamail' program
by `decode'.

Before calling `metamail', the environment variable METAMAIL_PAGER
is set to the value of the variable PAGER. If `mimenoask' mail
variable is set, its value is passed to `metamail' via MM_NOASK
environment variable.

Unsetting `metamail' variable turns off special interpretation
of MIME parts.

* from
The `from' utility was rewritten. It is now fully compatible with the
BSD version.

* frm
Implemented -t (--align) command line option.
Whenever available, `frm' uses BIDI algorithm for display. This
allows for correct display of subject lines written in languages
with right to left script orientation (Arabic, Hebrew).

* Maildir support
Implemented removal of messages.

* New SQL driver: odbc

* New authentication method: radius

* Ukrainian localization

* Bugfixes

** Fixed possible mailbox corruption in imap4d
** imap4d subscribe/unsubscribe was not working
** Fixed displaying mail headers in different languages (mail,frm,from)
** SQL authentication: prevent sql injection attacks
** Fixed bug in the default syslog diagnostic printer
** Fixed potential vulnerabilities: IDEF0954, IDEF0955, IDEF0956, IDEF0957
** `Imap:' mailboxes (remote mailboxes opened via imap interface) honor
read-only mode.
** Fixed date support in maildir (header fields Date, Envelope-Date and
Delivery-Date). 
** Fixed RFC 2047 encoding.
** Fixed folder_list() function.


Version 0.6:

* New features:

** Both imap4d and pop3d accept new command line option `--tls-required'.

The option disables any authentication commands until the client party
establishes TLS connection with the server.

** Pop3d server accepts new option `--delete-expired'.

This option is to be used together with `--expire'. It enables
automatic deletion of expired messages before closing the
mailbox. Previous versions of pop3d relied on a cron job that
was supposed to purge users' mailboxes, but such usage is extremely
ineffective for mail servers with considerable number of users.

** The package can be compiled with support for both MySQL and PostgreSQL
simultaneously. Which of the interfaces to use is defined at run time
by --sql-interface option.

** Mail.local is able to retrieve mailbox quotas from SQL database.

* movemail: Special mode for interfacing with Emacs (--emacs option)

* Bug fixes


Version 0.5:

* New features:

** Autodetection of local folder formats.

"Local" is a format of mail folder that uses local disk (possibly via
NFS) as its storage medium. Currently mailutils is able to handle
three local formats: UNIX mailbox, MH and Maildir. Usually these are
specified using a corresponding URL prefix. However, if an absolute
path name is given instead of a fully qualified URL, mailutils tries to
autodetect the format of the folder in question and handle it
appropriately (previous versions of mailutils assumed the folder
to be in UNIX mailbox format).

** movemail: new program

Moves mail from the user maildrop (remote or local) to the local file.
It supports all mailbox formats, supported by mailutils.

** Support for "maildir" format.

** sieve:

*** Considerably improved debugging diagnostics.
*** New sieve extension tests:

  spamd	      -		An interface to SpamAssassin daemon
  list	      -		Test headers, structured as lists of values.
  timestamp   -		Compares headers containing dates. 

** mail
*** Support for -a option (append header)
*** New command 'sendheaders' allows to pre-set the headers to be added to
the message.
*** New commands 'sender' and 'nosender' allow to set up a list
of header fields used to determine the sender of the message.
*** New variable 'xmailer' controls whether an X-Mailer header should
be added to outgoing messages.
*** New variables 'datefield' and 'emptystart' for compatibility with
nail
*** New variable 'decode-fallback' controls how to represent the characters
that cannot be rendered using current character set.

** mail.remote
*** Support for -t option (read recipients from the message). This fixes
the bug reported lately where mail.remote sends mail to all addresses
in the message, not just the addresses explicitly listed on the
command line.

** pop3d
*** New option --login-delay. Support for login-delay
*** New option --undelete. Forces pop3d to clear deletion
marks from all messages after opening the mailbox.

* Bug fixes:

** libmailbox
*** Fixed incorrect handling of underscores in Quoted-Printable encoding.
*** rfc2047_decode() takes into account input and output
character sets.

** mh
*** (formataddr): Fixed checking for duplicate addresses.

** pop3d:
*** Do not save delete marks when exiting on timeout.

** imap4d
*** Fixed bug that prevented SASL from working over a TLS encrypted
channel.
*** IDLE works on TLS connections.


Version 0.4:

* Bug fixes:

** Fixed improper use of size_t instead of off_t which caused
coredumps on systems where the two types have different sizes.

** iterator_t is rewritten to make list traversal more effective.
Traversing the list of n elements takes O(n), instead of O(n*(n+1)/2)
time units.

** Fixed memory allocation bug in mailbox/mu_auth.c

** Various fixes and improvements in MH in order to interoperate better
with MH-E.

** Correctly handle MIME parts with an empty body.

* Major Changes

** The library has been split into the core library (libmailbox), and
the protocol implementation libraries, which are named as
libmu_$PROTO. For example, the library for MBOX mailbox formats is
libmu_mbox.so.

** The support for TLS protocol has been added to libmu_imap.so and
libmu_pop.so. This means that you can now use TLS with every
Mailutils client program.

* New features.

** libmailbox

** See "Major Changes"

*** implemented header unfolding

*** argcv_get unescapes all unprintable characters, argcv_string
escapes them.

** libsieve: Implemented boolean shortcuts for evaluating ALLOF and
ANYOF

** pop3d

*** more extensive diagnostics for APOP authentications

*** Save headers even if the session was aborted. This ensures
the persistence of message unique-ids as required by RFC 1939.

*** popauth: new option --create.

The option allows to convert a plaintext file into DBM database.

** mail

*** New configuration file variable `mailx' enables the mailx
compatibility mode. This is mainly visible when composing a message.
In mailx compatibility mode, mail asks for Cc and Bcc addresses after
composing the body.
The default behavior is to ask for these values before composing
the body.

*** New variable `charset' controls the decoding of MIME-encoded headers
(rfc2047).

*** New commands `unfold' and `nounfold' allow to specify the headers
whose values should be unfolded before display.

* mh

Lots of bugfixes regarding compatibility issues and interoperation
with MH-E. This version of MH has been tested with MH-E 7.4.2+cvs.

** New program: ali

** New profile variables:
*** Charset
Controls the character set in which the components decoded via
the `decode' format function should be output.

*** Reply-Regex
Sets the regular expression used to recognize reply messages.

** New format functions
*** reply_regex
Sets the regular expression used to recognize reply messages.

*** isreply
Returns true if its argument is the reply message subject string,
i.e. if it matches the "reply subject" regular expression.


Version 0.3.1:

This version is a maintenance release over the previous one.

* Bug fixes:

** A replacement for vsyslog is provided for systems lacking it.
** Fixed incorrect handling of dates.
** Added support for handling Fcc: headers to the mailer code.
** Several minor fixes to allow the package to compile on MacOS.

* New features:

** Support for authentication against PostgreSQL databases.

* libmailbox:

** First implementation of rfc1524: added a set of functions for handling
mail capabilities

* mh: All utilities needed by Emacs mh-e.el module are implemented.


Version 0.3:

* General:

** Added NLS support. Currently Catalan and Spanish translations
are available.

** Fixed compilation with the newer versions of Berkeley DB.

* libmailbox:

** Functions for generating References: and In-Reply-To: headers as
per RFC 2822.

** A set of functions for sequential access to streams.

** The function mu_errstring is renamed to mu_strerror for consistency
with the usual practice.

** Added initial implementation of message header encoding and decoding
functions (RFC 2047).

* libsieve:

** The syntax of multiline strings is extended. It is possible
to use arbitrary ending delimiter instead of the default dot,
and to strip off the leading tabs, which allows for natural
indentation of the multiline strings.

** Added support for relational tests according to RFC 3431.

** Fixed incorrect handling of multiple addresses in `address'
tests.

* imap4d:

** The untagged output was fixed to conform to the RFC 2060. Specifically,
the output of STORE command is corrected in accordance with the
rfc2060-errata document; the EXIST and RECENT untagged are always
returned by EXAMINE, SELECT, and NOOP.

** Added support for TLS and GSASL.

** Implemented LOGINDISABLED capability.

** Implemented IDLE command (RFC 2177).

* pop3d: Added TLS support.

* mail: Fixed error diagnostics and removed startup banner.

* mh: Initial implementation. The basic MH utilities are implemented
that allow to use the package with the GNU Emacs mh-e module. Please
refer to the files README and TODO in the mh subdirectory.


Version 0.2:

* libmailbox: Several bugfixes. The configuration suite allows
  to disable support for any protocol or mailbox format to reduce
  the size of the library.

* Added new utility mailutils-config. This utility prints gcc command
  line options needed for compiling and linknig an application against
  mailutils.

* libsieve: New library. Supports Sieve language as described in
  RFC 3028 and provides a mechanism for dynamic loading of
  user-defined actions, tests and comparators.

* sieve: Completely rewritten using libsieve.

* sieve.scm: Added vacation extension action.

* mail.local: Allows to apply user-defined sieve filters before delivering
  messages.

* mail utility: Added `editheaders' boolean variable. When set, the
  user is allowed to edit headers of the message.
  Message set specification allows negation of search primitives, e.g.
  `from ! subject:/daily/' outputs all messages whose subject
  does not contain the word 'daily'.
  Reply command correctly adds `In-Reply-To' and `References' headers
  to outgoing messages.
  When used with a numeric argument '=' command sets the current
  message to this number.
  New command `setenv' allows to set and examine environment
  variables.
  The semantics of `crt' variable is made compatible with that of
  other implementations.
  Fixed several bugs.

* libmu_scm: Added support for Guile 1.7.0
