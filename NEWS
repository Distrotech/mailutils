Version 0.2:

* libmailbox: Several bugfixes. The configuration testsute allows
  to disable support for any protocol or mailbox format to reduce
  the size of the library.

* libsieve: New library. Supports Sieve language as described in
  RFC 3028 and provides a mechanism for dynamic loading of
  user-defined actions, tests and comparators.

* sieve: Completely rewritten using libsieve.

* sieve.scm: Added vacation extension action.

* mail.local: Allows to apply user-defined sieve filters before delivering
  messages.

* mail utility: Added `editheaders' boolean variable. When set, the
  user is allowed to edit headers of the message.
  Message set specification allows negation of search primitives, e.g.
  `from ! subject:/daily/' outputs all messages whose subject
  does not contain the word 'daily'.
  Reply command correctly adds `In-Reply-To' and `References' headers
  to outgoing messages.
  When used with a numeric argument '=' command sets the current
  message to this number.
  New command `setenv' allows to set and examine environment
  variables.
  The semantics of `crt' variable is made compatible with that of
  other implementations.
  Fixed several bugs.

* libmu_scm: Added support for Guile 1.7.0
