[docs]

- review examples in docs. many don't build. I think there needs to be a way
  of building the examples, and then converting them to texinfo, its the
  only way we'll always know they aren't garbage. Broken examples: stream.texi

[mailbox or mailbox2]

IMPORTANT:
  There is currently a rewrite of the mailbox call mailbox2 to address
  some of the flaws of the old version.

- generalized search interface

[pop3]
+ find out why the pop3 server quits on a signal when the 'quit' command is
  given

+ test daemon code

+ test network code

+ crypt is linked even if pam was detected, it should be one or the other (JB Oct 08/99)

- SSL support

[imap4d]

- Check interaction with imap clients.

- Better support of multi-access mailbox

- implement charsets in search: 1 SEARCH CHARSET ISO-8859-2 TEXT ...

- implement AUTHENTICATE command (at least kerberos?)

[mail]

- Add MIME support.

[mailbox]

- finish rewrite 8-)

- Configuration API

- Mailcap API

- Mime.types API

- imap4 client login referals

- imap4 client mailbox referals

- Maildir mailbox support

- mailbox locking
  - mutt has a way to lock mailboxes that are symlinks, can mailutils use
    its algorithm?
  - could mutt use a setgid external program to do dotlocking?
  - why does mimetest fail on a symlink, but suceed on a dotlocked file?

+ support AUTH=anonymous (imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus)
+ probably the AUTH should be allocated on creation, when the url is
  looked at, and rejected then, for now return ENOTSUP at folder_imap.c:327

[mbox]

- unify the mbox-* and mimetest examples with messages, it would be nice
  to have a general purpose tool

[sieve]

- bug: imap_fetch() can loop forever when sieve tries fileinto (sr - seen
    at work against a Domino IMAP server, the server is buggy, but we
    still shouldn't busy loop)

- clean up diagnostics
 - fileinto action dies badly when the mailbox lock failed
 - make log function a callback

The 5 actions:

+ keep

+ fileinto

+ discard

- redirect (need to modify mail sending interface to control envelope
    addresses)

- reject (need to from MDNs)

- run as daemon, sieveing mail on arrival (need interface for notification
  of message arrival, this is supported by imap, but we'll have to fake
  for pop and local spools my polling, why can't you select() on a unix
  file?)

[utilities]

- forward only MTA, nullmailer like, but accepting SMTP on 25 from localhost

- utility to move all mail from one mailbox to another, like mbox to
  IMAP, preserving all flags that are possible. can sieve do this?

- file viewer, based on the mimetypes api. I want to do a "v foo.blah",
  have it look up .blah in mime.types, and do the action speced in mailcap.

[all]

- add nightly build

- add more features

- optimize everything

- test everything

+ add imap server code (JB && Shaleh Oct 11/99)
