[mailbox or mailbox2]

IMPORTANT:
  There is currently a rewrite of the mailbox call mailbox2 to address
  some of the flaws of the old version.

- generalized search interface
+ support AUTH=anonymous (imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus)
+ probably the AUTH should be allocated on creation, when the url is
  looked at, and rejected then, for now return ENOTSUP at folder_imap.c:327

[pop3]
+ find out why the pop3 server quits on a signal when the 'quit' command is
  given

+ test daemon code

+ test network code

+ crypt is linked even if pam was detected, it should be one or the other (JB Oct 08/99)

- SSL support

[imap4d]

- Check interaction with imap clients.

- Better support of multi-access mailbox

- implement charsets in search: 1 SEARCH CHARSET ISO-8859-2 TEXT ...

- implement AUTHENTICATE command (at least kerberos?)

[mail]

- Add MIME support.

[mailbox]

- finish rewrite 8-)

- Configuration API

- Mailcap API

- Mime.types API

- imap4 client login referals

- imap4 client mailbox referals

- Maildir mailbox support

[sieve]

- bug: imap_fetch() can loop forever when sieve tries fileinto (sr - seen
    at work against a Domino IMAP server)

* clean up diagnostics

The 5 actions:

+ keep

+ fileinto

+ discard

- redirect (need to modify mail sending interface to control envelope
    addresses)

- reject (need to from MDNs)

- run as daemon, sieveing mail on arrival (need interface for notification
  of message arrival, this is supported by imap, but we'll have to fake
  for pop and local spools my polling, why can't you select() on a unix
  file?)

[utilities]

- forward only MTA, nullmailer like, but accepting SMTP on 25 from localhost

- utility to move all mail from one mailbox to another, like mbox to
  IMAP, preserving all flags that are possible. can sieve do this?

[all]

- add nightly build

- add more features

- optimize everything

- test everything

+ add imap server code (JB && Shaleh Oct 11/99)
