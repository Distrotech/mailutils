[libmailbox]

* autogen.sh (libtool) complains about libmailbox.la in noinst (JB Oct 08/99)

- added more includes, make sure autoconf finds them

- need an interface to set flags for each message

- need an interface to set and create values in the header

- unixmbox's open function needs to be split into an open and a parse function

- needs a search ability

- unixmbox needs expunge working

+ libmailbox has a nasty bug -- if the mailbox is empty, the library has no idea
  what to do (Shaleh Oct 07/99)

* Maildir is VERY rough
  
[mail]

- clean up 'mail''s compilation, why is there a mail script?

[pop3]

- find out why the pop3 server quits on a signal when the 'quit' command is
  given

- test daemon code

- test network code

+ crypt is linked even if pam was detected, it should be one or the other (JB Oct 08/99)

[imap4d]

- Check interaction with imap clients.

- implement charsets in search: 1 SEARCH CHARSET ISO-8859-2 TEXT ...

- implement AUTHENTICATE command (at least kerberos?)

[mail]

- Add MIME support.

[sieve]

* clean up diagnostics

The 5 actions:

+ keep

+ fileinto

+ discard

- redirect (need to modify mail sending interface to control envelope
    addresses)

- reject (need to from MDNs)

- run as daemon, sieveing mail on arrival (need interface for notification
  of message arrival, this is supported by imap, but we'll have to fake
  for pop and local spools my polling, why can't you select() on a unix
  file?)

[all]
- add more features

- optimize everything

- test everything

+ add imap server code (JB && Shaleh Oct 11/99)
