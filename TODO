GNU mailutils TODO list. 2010-12-21
Copyright (C) 2001-2008, 2010-2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

* Provide a generic way to store UID, UIDNEXT and UIDVALIDITY in mailboxes.

* prog_stream: provide a way to startup environment

* redo the support of the default user email and mail domain.

* use the above in message_stream.

* envelope: date returned by mu_envelope_?get_date must not end with a \n

See also mu_rfc2822_in_reply_to.

* Check if _mu_smtp_trace_disable correctly dereferences streams.

* re-implement nntp client

* properties:

** consider a possibility of typed properties (integer, unsigned, string, ...)

* remove libmu_auth, rewrite mu_auth support via mu_property_t

* locale-dependent variant of mu_rfc2047_decode

See rfc2047_decode_wrapper in frm/common.c for a prototype.

* observer: allow for procedure-data closures

See frm/common.c (near line 425).

* mu_address_createv: pass hints as in mu_address_create_hint?

* fix C++ support

* redo libraries as loadable modules (where possible)

* Configuration callback functions should not modify node->tag and node->label.

* mailbox 

** Generic search interface

** Locking

*** Implement a read/write locker_lock() flag so that when MU_LOCKER_WRONLY
is set in the locker flags, only write locks actually lock the file,
read locks don't do anything.

*** reportedly mimetest fails on a symlink, but succeeds on a dotlocked file?

* mu_cpystr - revise the use of. 

* support AUTH=anonymous (imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus)

* mail aliasing support in libmailutils

Use code from MH.

* imap4d

** Check interaction with various imap clients. Currently tested with:
mail (from mailutils itself), mutt, pine, netscape, mozilla,
thunderbird, roundcube.

** Better support of multi-access mailboxes?

** implement charsets in search: 1 SEARCH CHARSET ISO-8859-2 TEXT ...

** implement AUTHENTICATE KERBEROS_V4 and SKEY and SRP?

** Implement extensions:

 - QUOTA     : RFC 2087
 - ACL       : RFC 4314
 - CHILDREN  : RFC 3348
 
** Consider implementing the following extensions:

 - CONDSTORE : RFC 4551
 - ESEARCH   : RFC 4731
 - SEARCHRES : RFC 5182

* Mailcap API

The framework is implemented. Needs extensive testing.

* Mime.types API is available in mimeview. Do we need to move it to
libmailbox?

* mh -- see mh/TODO

* utilities

** mimeview: support nametemplate

* stream: associate with input location (mu_locus_t or the like).

This is already implemented in logstream.  Does it make sense for
streams in general?
