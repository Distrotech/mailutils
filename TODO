[docs]

- review examples in docs. many don't build. I think there needs to be a way
  of building the examples, and then converting them to texinfo, its the
  only way we'll always know they aren't garbage. Broken examples: stream.texi

[mailbox or mailbox2]

IMPORTANT:
  There is currently a rewrite of the mailbox call mailbox2 to address
  some of the flaws of the old version.

- generalized search interface

[pop3]
+ find out why the pop3 server quits on a signal when the 'quit' command is
  given

+ test daemon code

+ test network code

+ crypt is linked even if pam was detected, it should be one or the other (JB Oct 08/99)

- SSL support

[imap4d]

- Check interaction with imap clients.

- Better support of multi-access mailbox

- implement charsets in search: 1 SEARCH CHARSET ISO-8859-2 TEXT ...

- implement AUTHENTICATE KERBEROS_V4 and SKEY

[mail]

- Add MIME support.

[mailbox]

- mu_cpystr - the size_t* size outputs only give strlen(), not the
  actual length?

- finish mh mailboxe support (they don't have a folder yet)

- need code to find a "real" envelope from... an actual email address
  that DSNs can be sent to.

- mailer_t: the SMTP mailer isn't as fully implemented as the sendmail
  mailer.

- header_get_value() returns the newline?

- implement a header_field_unfold()?

- finish rewrite 8-)

- pipe_open_stream() - implemented with popen()

- Configuration API

- Mailcap API

- Mime.types API

- A ticket file format allowing specification of different authentication
  information for different mailboxes.

- imap4 client login referals

- imap4 client mailbox referals

- Maildir mailbox support

- mailbox locking
  - mutt has a way to lock mailboxes that are symlinks, can mailutils use
    its algorithm?
  - could mutt use a setgid external program to do dotlocking?
  - why does mimetest fail on a symlink, but suceed on a dotlocked file?

+ support AUTH=anonymous (imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus)
+ probably the AUTH should be allocated on creation, when the url is
  looked at, and rejected then, for now return ENOTSUP at folder_imap.c:327

[examples]

- unify the mbox-* and mimetest examples with messages, it would be nice
  to have a general purpose tool

[sieve]

- argp

- clean up diagnostics
 - fileinto action dies badly when the mailbox lock failed
 + make log function a callback
 - get rid of the awful xalloc()

- need user contexts, and for the action_log to be only if verbose

- uid isn't good to identify messages, use message-id?

- also need to provide context to the sv_*() functions (I could tuck
  message number in it, and mailbox name).

- run as daemon, sieveing mail on arrival (need interface for notification
  of message arrival, this is supported by imap, but we'll have to fake
  for pop and local spools my polling, why can't you select() on a unix
  file?)

The 5 actions:

+ keep

+ fileinto

+ discard

+ redirect

- reject (need to form MDNs)

Extention actions:

- REGEX

- vacation

[utilities]

- forward only MTA, nullmailer like, but accepting SMTP on 25 from localhost

- utility to move all mail from one mailbox to another, like mbox to
  IMAP, preserving all flags that are possible. can sieve do this, or do
  I need a mbox-copy() utility?

- file viewer, based on the mimetypes api. I want to do a "v foo.blah",
  have it look up .blah in mime.types, and do the action spec'ed in mailcap.

[all]

- add nightly build

- add more features

- optimize everything

- test everything

+ add imap server code (JB && Shaleh Oct 11/99)
