[mailbox or mailbox2]

- generalized search interface
- support AUTH=anonymous imap, imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus

[pop3]
+ find out why the pop3 server quits on a signal when the 'quit' command is
  given

+ test daemon code

+ test network code

+ crypt is linked even if pam was detected, it should be one or the other (JB Oct 08/99)

[imap4d]

- Check interaction with imap clients.

- implement charsets in search: 1 SEARCH CHARSET ISO-8859-2 TEXT ...

- implement AUTHENTICATE command (at least kerberos?)

[mail]

- Add MIME support.

[sieve]

- bug: imap_fetch() can loop forever when sieve tries fileinto (sr - seen
    at work against a Domino IMAP server)

* clean up diagnostics

The 5 actions:

+ keep

+ fileinto

+ discard

- redirect (need to modify mail sending interface to control envelope
    addresses)

- reject (need to from MDNs)

- run as daemon, sieveing mail on arrival (need interface for notification
  of message arrival, this is supported by imap, but we'll have to fake
  for pop and local spools my polling, why can't you select() on a unix
  file?)

[all]

- add more features

- optimize everything

- test everything

+ add imap server code (JB && Shaleh Oct 11/99)
