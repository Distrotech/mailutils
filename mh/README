README -- Differences between Mailutils and the RAND implementation of MH:


* All programs use usual GNU long options. The support for MH single-dot
options is provided for backward compatibility.

* Format specifications

** New functions

*** unre
Argument: string
Return: string

The function removes any leading whitespace and eventual "Re:" prefix
from its argument. Useful for creating subjects in reply messages:

	%<{subject}Subject: Re: %(unre{subject})\\n%>

*** rcpt
Argument: string, one of "to", "cc", "me", "all"
Return: boolean

This function returns true if the given element is present in the
recipient mask (as modified by any --cc and --nocc options) and
false otherwise. It is used in default formats for repl and comp, e.g.:

	%(lit)%<(rcpt to)%(formataddr{to})%>

Notice that this means that usual replcomps file will be ignoring
--cc and --nocc options, unless it has been modified as shown above.

*** concat
Argument: string
Return: none

Appends whitespace + arg to string register.

*** printstr
Argument: string
Return: none

Prints the value of string register, prefixed by the given argument.

*** in_reply_to
Argument: none
Return: string

Generates the value for the In-reply-to: header according to RFC 2822.

*** references
Argument: none
Return: string

Generates the value for the References: header according to RFC 2822.

* rmm

** Different behaviour if one of the messages in the list does not exist.

Mailutils rmm does not delete any messages. Standard rmm in this case
deletes all messages preceeding the non-existent one.

** The rmmproc: profile component is not used.

* fmtdump command is not provided. Use fmtcheck instead.
