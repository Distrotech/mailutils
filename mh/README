README -- Differences between Mailutils and the RAND implementation of MH:


* All programs use usual GNU long options. The support for MH single-dot
options is provided for backward compatibility.

* Format specifications
** Function unre
This function is a GNU extension. It removes any leading whitespace
and eventual "Re:" prefix from its string argument. Useful for creating
subjects in reply messages:

	%<{subject}Subject: Re: %(unre{subject})\\n%>

** Function rcpt
Mailutils provides new format function rcpt. The function takes a
string argument (one of "to", "cc", "me", "all") and returns true
if the given element is present in the recipient mask (as modified
by any --cc and --nocc options) and false otherwise. It is used in
default formats for repl and comp, e.g.:

	%(lit)%<(rcpt to)%(formataddr{to})%>

Notice that this means that usual replcomps file will be ignoring
--cc and --nocc options, unless it has been modified as shown above.

** Function concat
Appends whitespace + arg to str.

** Function printstr
Prints the value of string register, prefixed by the given argument.

* rmm

** Different behaviour if one of the messages in the list does not exist.

Mailutils rmm does not delete any messages. Standard rmm in this case
deletes all messages preceeding the non-existent one.

** The rmmproc: profile component is not used.

* fmtdump command is not provided. Use fmtcheck instead.
