The GNU implementation of MH is primarily aiming to provide an interface
between Mailutils and Emacs using mh-e module. Therefore, a subset of MH
utilities has been selected that would provide such basic functionality.
When this functionality is achieved, other utilities may be implemented.

Utilities Ordered by Importance
===============================

The `State' column gives the state of the given utility:

- Not implemented
+ Fully implemented
* Partially implemented. The `Comments' column lists the missing features.

The `Nice' column gives aproximate priority of the utility in the terms
of unix nice level (-20 the highest, +20 the lowest)

+       20      show            next, prev not implemented
