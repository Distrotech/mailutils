The GNU implementation of MH is primarily aiming to provide an interface
between Mailutils and Emacs using mh-e module. Therefore, a subset of MH
utilities has been selected that would provide such basic functionality.
When this functionality is achieved, other utilities may be implemented.

Utilities Ordered by Importance
===============================

The `State' column gives the state of the given utility:

- Not implemented
+ Fully implemented
* Partially implemented. The `Comments' column lists the missing features

The `Nice' column gives aproximate priority of the utility in the terms
of unix nice level (-20 the highest, +20 the lowest)

State	Nice	Utility		Comments
-------------------------------------------
+	-20	scan
+	-20	inc
*	-20	repl		See comments for whatnow
-	-20	comp
-	-20	forw
-	-20	send
*	-20	refile		--link
*	-20	rmm		rmproc:	
*	-15	folder(s)	--pack,--verbose
-	-15	mhn
+	-10	rmf
-	0	install-mh	Not necessary. Will be implemented as a noop
-	4	mhl
-	5	mark
-	5	pick
-	10	anno
-	10	burst
-	10	whom
+	10	mhpath
*	10	whatnow		push,refile,send are not supported. 
-	20	sortm
