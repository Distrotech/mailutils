The GNU implementation of MH is primarily aiming to provide an interface
between Mailutils and Emacs using mh-e module. Therefore, a subset of MH
utilities has been selected that would provide such basic functionality.
When this functionality is achieved, other utilities may be implemented.

Utilities Ordered by Importance
===============================

The `State' column gives the state of the given utility:

- Not implemented
+ Fully implemented
* Partially implemented. The `Comments' column lists the missing features.

The `Nice' column gives aproximate priority of the utility in the terms
of unix nice level (-20 the highest, +20 the lowest)

State	Nice	Utility		Comments
-------------------------------------------
+	-20	scan
+	-20	inc
*	-20	repl		See comments for whatnow. -filter is not impl.
+	-20	comp		See comments for whatnow
-	-20	forw
*	-20	send		--alias,--filter,--format,--forward,--mime,
				--split,--width
*	-20	refile		--link
*	-20	rmm		rmproc:	
*	-15	folder(s)	--pack,--verbose
-	-15	mhn
+	-10	rmf
+	0	install-mh	
*	4	mhl		Following format variables are ignored:
				center,split,datefield
+	5	mark
*	5	pick		--before and --after are not supported. See
				also the README entry for it.
