To convert a sieve script into equivalent Scheme program, run:

     sieve.scm --file <sieve-script-name> --output <scm-file-name>

The produced script can then be run as:

     guile -s <scm-file-name> [MAILBOX]

  If MAILBOX is not given, the script will operate upon the user's system 
mailbox. 

  To invoke the script directly by its name, add executable bit to its 
permissions. 

  The same script may be used by maidag to sieve the incoming mail upon
its arrival, see node "Programs -> maidag" in the accompanying 
documentation for more information on this.

  To execute the sieve script directly, without saving the produced Scheme
text to a file, run:

     sieve.scm --file <sieve-script-name> [MAILBOX]

The semantics of MAILBOX argument is described above.
