;;;; This module provides sieve's "redirect" action.

;;; rfc3028 says: 
;;; "Implementations SHOULD take measures to implement loop control,"
;;; We do this by appending an "X-Sender" header to each message
;;; being redirected. If one of the "X-Sender" headers of the message
;;; contains our email address, we assume it is a loop and bail out.
