Known errors in RFC 2060 as of 13 September 1998:

1) The SELECT and EXAMINE response list does not mention UIDVALIDITY.

2) In the definition of store_att_flags, #flag should be 1#flag; in other
   words, at least one flag must be given.  To do an empty list of flags,
   you must use the parenthesized form: "()".

3) The example in 6.4.6 is missing parenthesis around the FETCH attributes.
   It should read:

   Example:    C: A003 STORE 2:4 +FLAGS (\Deleted)
               S: * 2 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted \Seen))
               S: * 3 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted))
               S: * 4 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted \Flagged \Seen))
               S: A003 OK STORE completed

4) Section 7.4.2 has an example of "a two part message consisting of a
   text and a BASE645-encoded text attachment".  "BASE645" should be
   BASE64.

5) In the example in 7.4.2 discussed above, there is a spurious close
   parenthesis at the end of the example.

6) Spurious obsolete response "MAILBOX" is listed in mailbox_data and
   should be removed.

7) There is a spurious "<" in the mailbox_data rule that should be removed.

8) CRLF is missing from the continue_req rule.

9) The atom in resp_text_code should specifically exclude "]".

10) The example in 6.3.11 does not show the command continuation request.

11) NEWNAME is missing from resp_text_code.

12) There is a missing open parenthesis in the media_basic grammar rule.

13) Status attributes are incorrectly defined in mailbox_data rule.

14) The UID FETCH example is missing an "OK" in the response.

15) Multipart extension data incorrectly specifies that language must be
    given along with disposition.
