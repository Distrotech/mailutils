1 Introduction
**************

GNU Mailutils is a set of libraries and utilities for handling
electronic mail.  It addresses a wide audience and can be of interest
to application developers, casual users and system administrators alike.

   It provides programmers with a consistent API allowing them to
handle a variety of different mailbox formats transparently and without
having to delve into complexities of their internal structure.  While
doing so, it also provides interfaces that simplify common programming
tasks, such as handling lists, parsing configuration files, etc.  The
philosophy of Mailutils is to have a single and consistent programming
interface for various objects designed to handle the same task.  It
tries to use their similarities to create an interface that hides their
differences and complexities.  This covers a wide variety of
programming tasks: apart from mailbox handling, Mailutils also contains
a unified iterface for work with various DBM databases and much more.

   The utilities built upon these libraries share that same distinctive
feature: no matter what is the internal structure of an object, it is
always handled the same way as other objects that do the same task.
Again, the most common example of this approach are, of course,
mailboxes.  Whatever Mailutils program you use, you can be sure it is
able to handle various mailbox formats.  You even don't have to inform
it about what type a mailbox is: it will do its best to discover it
automatically.

   This approach sometimes covers entities which are seldom regarded as
compatible.  For example, using Mailutils it is possible to treat an
SMTP connection as a mailbox opened only for appending new messages.
This in turn, provides a way for extending the functionality of some
utilities.  As an example, using this concept of mailboxes, the usual
mail delivery agent becomes able to do things usually reserved for mail
transport agents only!

   At the core of Mailutils is `libmailutils', a library which provides
an API for accessing a generalized mailbox.  A set of complementary
libraries provide methods for handling particular mailbox
implementations: UNIX mailbox, Maildir, MH, POP3, IMAP4, even SMTP.
Mailutils offers functions for almost any mail-related task, such as
parsing of messages, email addresses and URLs, handling MIME messages,
listing mail folders, mailcap facilities, extensible Sieve filtering,
access control lists.  It supports various modern data security and
authentication techniques: TLS encryption, SASL and GSSAPI, to name a
few.  Mailutils is able to work with a wide variety of authorization
databases, ranging from traditional system password database up to
RADIUS, SQL and LDAP.

   The utilities provided by Mailutils include `imap4d' and `pop3d'
mail servers, mail reporting utility `comsatd', general-purpose mail
delivery agent `maidag', mail filtering program `sieve', an
implementation of MH message handling system and much more.

   All utilities share the same subset of command line options and use
a unified configuration mechanism, which allows to easily configure the
package as a whole.

1.1 What this Book Contains
===========================


*Editor's note:* This is more a plan on how the document should be
structured, than a description of its actual structure.  However it is:

This book addresses a wide audience of both system administrators and
users that aim to use Mailutils programs, and programmers who wish to
use Mailutils libraries in their programs.  Given this audience, the
book is divided in three major parts.

   The first part provides a detailed description of each Mailutils
utility, and advices on how to use them in various situations.  This
part is intended for users and system administrators who are using
Mailutils programs.  If you are not interested in programming using
Mailutils, this is the only part you need to read.

   Subsequent parts address programmers.

   The second part is a tutorial which provides an introduction to
programming techniques for writing mail applications using GNU
Mailutils.

   Finally, the third part contains a complete Mailutils library
reference.

   This version of the book is not finished.  The places that may
contain inaccurate information carry prominent notices stating so.  For
updated versions of the documentation, visit
`http://mailutils.org/manual'.  All material that ends up in this
document is first published in the Mailutils Wiki, available at
`http://mailutils.org/wiki'.  Be sure to visit it for latest updates.

   If you have any questions that are not answered there, feel free to
ask them at the mailing list <bug-mailutils@gnu.org>.


   *Editor's note:* Mailutils 3.0 introduced such amount of changes,
most of which being a complete rewrite of the existing codebase, that
the library tutorial and reference became hopelessly obsolete.  It is
my deep conviction that using incorrect documentation is much worse than
having no documentation at all, therefore I have withdrawn the obsolete
parts from this edition of GNU Mailutils manual.  I am doing my best to
document new Mailutils libraries and hope to be able to re-introduce
these parts of the documentation soon.

1.2 A bit of History, and why use this package?
===============================================

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

This package started off to try and handle large mailbox files more
gracefully then available at that time POP3 servers did.  While it
handles this task, it also allows you to support a variety of different
mailbox formats without any real effort on your part. Also, if a new
format is added at a later date, your program will support that new
format automatically as soon as it is compiled against the new library.

3 Mailutils Programs
********************

GNU Mailutils provides a broad set of utilities for handling electronic
mail.  These utilities address the needs of both system administrators
and users.

   All utilities are built around a single core subsystem and share many
common aspects.  All of them are able to work with almost any existing
mailbox formats.  They use a common configuration file syntax, and
their configuration files are located in a single subdirectory.

   In this chapter we will discuss each utility, and give some advices
on how to use them in various real life situations.

   First of all we will describe command line and configuration file
syntax.

File: mailutils.info,  Node: Option Basics,  Next: Common Options,  Up: command line

3.1.1 Basic Notions About Command Line Options
----------------------------------------------

Many command line options have two forms, called short and long forms.
Both forms are absolutely identical in function; they are
interchangeable.

   The "short" form is a traditional form for UNIX utilities.  In this
form, the option consists of a single dash, followed by a single
letter, e.g.  `-c'.

   Short options which require arguments take their arguments
immediately following the option letter, optionally separated by white
space.  For example, you might write `-f name', or `-fname'.  Here,
`-f' is the option, and `name' is its argument.

   Short options which allow optional arguments take their arguments
immediately following the option letter, _without any intervening white
space characters_.  This is important, so that the command line parser
might discern that the text following option is its argument, not the
next command line parameter.  For example, if option `-d' took an
optional argument, then `-dname' would mean the option with its
argument (`name' in this case), and `-d name' would mean the `-d'
option without any argument, followed by command line argument `name'.

   Short options' letters may be clumped together, but you are not
required to do this.  When short options are clumped as a set, use one
(single) dash for them all, e.g.  `-cvl' is equivalent to `-c -v -l'.
However, only options that do not take arguments may be clustered this
way.  If an option takes an argument, it can only be the last option in
such a cluster, otherwise it would be impossible to specify the
argument for it.  Anyway, it is much more readable to specify such
options separated.

   The "long" option names are probably easier to memorize than their
short counterparts.  They consist of two dashes, followed by a
multi-letter option name, which is usually selected to be a mnemonics
for the operation it requests.  For example, `--verbose' is a long
option that increases the verbosity of a utility.  In addition, long
option names can abbreviated, provided that such an abbreviation is
unique among the options understood by a given utility.  For example,
if a utility takes options `--foreground' and `--forward', then the
shortest possible abbreviations for these options are `--fore' and
`--forw', correspondingly.  If you try to use `--for', the utility will
abort and inform you that the abbreviation you use is ambiguous, so it
is not clear which of the options you intended to use.

   Long options which require arguments take those arguments following
the option name.  There are two ways of specifying a mandatory
argument.  It can be separated from the option name either by an equal
sign, or by any amount of white space characters.  For example, if the
`--file' option requires an argument, and you wish to supply `name' as
its argument, then you can do so using any of the following notations:
`--file=name' or `--file name'.

   In contrast, optional arguments must always be introduced using an
equal sign.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Common Options,  Prev: Option Basics,  Up: command line

3.1.2 Options That are Common for All Utilities.
------------------------------------------------

All GNU Mailutils programs understand a common subset of options.

`--help'
`-?'
     Display a short summary of the command line options understood by
     this utilities, along with a terse description of each.

     The output of this option consists of three major parts.  First, a
     usage synopsis is displayed.  For example:

          Usage: sieve [OPTION...] SCRIPT
          GNU sieve -- a mail filtering tool

     The first line tells that the `sieve' utility takes any number of
     options (brackets indicate optional part) and a single mandatory
     argument (`SCRIPT').  The second lines summarizes the purpose of
     the utility.

     Following this header is an option summary.  It consists of two
     columns:

       -c, --compile-only         Compile script and exit
       -d, --debug[=FLAGS]        Debug flags
       -e, --email=ADDRESS        Override user email address

     The leftmost column contains a comma-separated list of option
     names.  Short options are listed first.  The options are ordered
     alphabetically.  Arguments, if any, are specified after the last
     option name in the list, so that, e.g. the option `-e' in the
     example above requires an argument: `-e ADDRESS'.  Optional
     arguments are enclosed in square brackets, as in `--debug' option
     in the example above.

     The rightmost column contains a short description of the option
     purpose.

     The last part of `--help' output contains some additional notices
     and lists the email address for reporting bugs.

`--usage'
     Display a short summary of options.  In the contrast to the
     `--help' option, only option names and arguments are printed,
     without any textual description.  For example:

          Usage: sieve [-cv?V] [--compile-only] [--debug[=FLAGS]]
                       [--email=ADDRESS] SCRIPT

   The exact formatting of the output produced by these two options is
configurable.  *Note Usage Vars::, for a detailed descriptions of it.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print program version and exit.

`--show-config-options'
     Show configuration options used when compiling the package.  You
     can use this option to verify if support for a particular mailbox
     format or other functionality is compiled in the binary.  The
     output of this option is intended to be both machine-readable and
     understandable by humans.

   The following command line options affect parsing of configuration
files.  Here we provide a short summary, the next section will describe
them in detail.

`--config-file=FILE'
     Load this configuration file, instead of the default.

`--config-help'
     Show configuration file summary.

`--config-lint'
     Check configuration file syntax and exit

`--config-verbose'
     Verbosely log parsing of the configuration files.

`--no-site-config'
     Do not load site-wide configuration file.

`--no-user-config'
     Do not load user configuration file.

`--set=PATH'
     Set configuration variable.

3.2 Mailutils Configuration File
================================

Configuration files are the principal means of configuring any GNU
Mailutils component.  When started, each utility tries to load its
configuration from the following locations, in that order:

  1. Main site-wide configuration file.

     It is named `SYSCONFDIR/mailutils.rc', where SYSCONFDIR stands for
     the system configuration directory set when compiling the package.
     You can obtain the value of SYSCONFDIR by running

          $ mailutils-config --info sysconfdir

     or

          $ PROG --show-config-options | grep SYSCONFDIR

     where PROG stands for any GNU Mailutils utility.

     The site-wide configuration file is not read if the
     `--no-site-config' command line option was given.

  2. Per-user configuration file.

     A per user configuration file is located in the user home directory
     and is named `.PROG', where PROG is the name of the utility.  For
     example, the per-user configuration file for `sieve' utility is
     named `.sieve'.

     This configuration file is not read if the `--no-user-config'
     command line option was given.

  3. Additional configuration file, if specified using the
     `--config-file' command line option.

   The order in which configuration files are loaded defines the
precedence of their settings.  Thus, the settings from additional
configuration file override those set in per-user configuration file.
The latter, in their turn, take precedence over the settings from the
site-wide configuration file.

   Neither site-wide nor user configuration files are required to
exist.  If any or both of them are absent, GNU Mailutils does not
complain, and the utility falls back to its default settings.  To make
configuration processing more verbose, use the `--config-verbose'
command line option.  Here is an example of what you might get using
this option:

     imap4d: Info: parsing file `/etc/mailutils.rc'
     imap4d: Info: finished parsing file `/etc/mailutils.rc'

   Specifying this option more than once adds more verbosity to this
output.  If this option is given two times, GNU Mailutils will print
any configuration file statement it parsed, along with the exact
location where it occurred (the exact meaning of each statement will be
described later in this chapter):

     imap4d: Info: parsing file `/etc/mailutils.rc'
     # 1 "/etc/mailutils.rc"
     mailbox {
     # 2 "/etc/mailutils.rc"
       mailbox-pattern maildir:/var/spool/mail;type=index;param=2;user=${user};
     # 3 "/etc/mailutils.rc"
       mailbox-type maildir;
     };
     # 6 "/etc/mailutils.rc"
     include /etc/mailutils.d;
     imap4d: Info: parsing file `/etc/mailutils.d/imap4d'
     ...

   To test configuration file without actually starting the utility,
use the `--config-lint' command line option.  With this option, any
Mailutils utility exits after finishing parsing of the configuration
files.  Any errors occurred during parsing are displayed on the
standard error output.  This option can be combined with
`--config-verbose' to obtain more detailed output.

   The `--config-help' command line option produces on the standard
output the summary of all configuration statements understood by the
utility, with detailed comments and in the form suitable for
configuration file.  For example, the simplest way to write a
configuration file for, say, `imap4d' is to run

     $ imap4d --config-help > imap4d.rc

and to edit the `imap4d.rc' file with your editor of choice.

   It is also possible to set or override arbitrary configuration
variables in the command line.  It can be done via the `--set' option.
Its argument is a "pathname" of the variable to be set.  For example,
to define the variable `syslog' in section `logging' to `no', do the
following:

     $ imap4d --set .logging.syslog=no

3.2.1 Configuration File Syntax
-------------------------------

The configuration file consists of statements and comments.

   There are three classes of lexical tokens: keywords, values, and
separators.  Blanks, tabs, newlines and comments, collectively called
"white space" are ignored except as they serve to separate tokens.
Some white space is required to separate otherwise adjacent keywords
and values.

* Menu:

* Comments::
* Statements::
* Paths::


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Statements,  Up: conf-syntax

3.2.1.1 Comments
................

"Comments" may appear anywhere where white space may appear in the
configuration file.  There are two kinds of comments: single-line and
multi-line comments.  "Single-line" comments start with `#' or `//' and
continue to the end of the line:

     # This is a comment
     // This too is a comment

   "Multi-line" or "C-style" comments start with the two characters
`/*' (slash, star) and continue until the first occurrence of `*/'
(star, slash).

   Multi-line comments cannot be nested.  However, single-line comments
may well appear within multi-line ones.

3.2.1.2 Statements
..................

A "simple statement" consists of a keyword and value separated by any
amount of whitespace.  Simple statement is terminated with a semicolon
(`;').

   The following is a simple statement:

     standalone yes;
     pidfile /var/run/pop3d.pid;

   A "keyword" begins with a letter and may contain letters, decimal
digits, underscores (`_') and dashes (`-').  Examples of keywords are:
`expression', `output-file'.

   A "value" can be one of the following:

number
     A number is a sequence of decimal digits.

boolean
     A boolean value is one of the following: `yes', `true', `t' or
     `1', meaning "true", and `no', `false', `nil', `0' meaning "false".

unquoted string
     An unquoted string may contain letters, digits, and any of the
     following characters: `_', `-', `.', `/', `@', `*', `:'.

quoted string
     A quoted string is any sequence of characters enclosed in
     double-quotes (`"').  A backslash appearing within a quoted string
     introduces an "escape sequence", which is replaced with a single
     character according to the following rules:

     Sequence             Replaced with
     \a                   Audible bell character (ASCII 7)
     \b                   Backspace character (ASCII 8)
     \f                   Form-feed character (ASCII 12)
     \n                   Newline character (ASCII 10)
     \r                   Carriage return character (ASCII
                          13)
     \t                   Horizontal tabulation character
                          (ASCII 9)
     \v                   Vertical tabulation character
                          (ASCII 11)
     \\                   A single backslash (`\')
     \"                   A double-quote.

     Table 3.1: Backslash escapes

        In addition, the sequence `\NEWLINE' is removed from the
     string.  This allows to split long strings over several physical
     lines, e.g.:

          "a long string may be\
           split over several lines"

        If the character following a backslash is not one of those
     specified above, the backslash is ignored and a warning is issued.

        Two or more adjacent quoted strings are concatenated, which
     gives another way to split long strings over several lines to
     improve readability.  The following fragment produces the same
     result as the example above:

          "a long string may be"
          " split over several lines"

  Here-document
        A "here-document" is a special construct that allows to
     introduce strings of text containing embedded newlines.

        The `<<WORD' construct instructs the parser to read all the
     following lines up to the line containing only WORD, with possible
     trailing blanks.  Any lines thus read are concatenated together
     into a single string.  For example:

          <<EOT
          A multiline
          string
          EOT

        The body of a here-document is interpreted the same way as a
     double-quoted string, unless WORD is preceded by a backslash (e.g.
     `<<\EOT') or enclosed in double-quotes, in which case the text is
     read as is, without interpretation of escape sequences.

        If WORD is prefixed with `-' (a dash), then all leading tab
     characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing
     WORD.  Furthermore, if `-' is followed by a single space, all
     leading whitespace is stripped from them.  This allows to indent
     here-documents in a natural fashion.  For example:

          <<- TEXT
              The leading whitespace will be
              ignored when reading these lines.
          TEXT

        It is important that the terminating delimiter be the only
     token on its line.  The only exception to this rule is allowed if a
     here-document appears as the last element of a statement.  In this
     case a semicolon can be placed on the same line with its
     terminating delimiter, as in:

          help-text <<-EOT
                  A sample help text.
          EOT;

  list
        A "list" is a comma-separated list of values.  Lists are
     enclosed in parentheses.  The following example shows a statement
     whose value is a list of strings:

          alias (test,null);

        In any case where a list is appropriate, a single value is
     allowed without being a member of a list: it is equivalent to a
     list with a single member.  This means that, e.g.

          alias test;

     is equivalent to

          alias (test);

   A "block statement" introduces a logical group of statements.  It
consists of a keyword, followed by an optional value, and a sequence of
statements enclosed in curly braces, as shown in the example below:

     server srv1 {
       host 10.0.0.1;
       community "foo";
     }

   The closing curly brace may be followed by a semicolon, although
this is not required.

3.2.1.3 Statement Path
......................

`Mailutils' configuration files have a distinct hierarchical structure.
Each statement in such files can therefore be identified by its name
and the names of block statements containing it.  Such names form this
statement "pathname", similar to that used, e.g. by UNIX file system.

   For example, consider the following file:

     foo {
       bar {
         baz 45;   # A.
       }
       baz 98;     # B.
     }

   The full pathname of the statement marked with `A' can be written as:

     .foo.bar.baz

   Similarly, the statement marked with `B' has the following pathname:

     .foo.baz

   The default path component separator is dot.  A pathname beginning
with a component separator is called "absolute pathname".  Absolute
pathnames uniquely identify corresponding statements.  If the leading
dot is omitted, the resulting pathname is called "relative".  Relative
pathnames identify statements in relation to the current point of
reference in the configuration file.

   Any other punctuation character can be used as a component separator,
provided that it appears at the beginning of the pathname.  In other
words, only absolute pathnames allow for a change in component
separators.

   A block statement that has a tag is referred to by its name, followed
by an equals sign, followed by the tag value.  For example, the
statement `A' in the file below:

     program x {
       bar {
         baz 45;   # A.
       }
     }

   is identified by the following pathname:

     .program=x.bar.baz

   The tag can optionally be enclosed in a pair of double quotes.  Such
a quoting becomes mandatory for tags that contain white space or path
component separator, e.g.:

     .program="a.out".bar.baz

3.2.2 Include Statement
-----------------------

The "include statement" is a special statement that causes inclusion of
a named file.  It has the following syntax:

     include FILE;

   If FILE names a regular file, the contents of this file is included
in this point.  Otherwise, if FILE names a directory, Mailutils
searches in that directory for a file whose name coincides with the
name of utility being executed, and includes this file, if it exists.

   It is a common approach to end the site-wide configuration file with
an include statement, e.g.:

     include /etc/mailutils.d;

   This allows each particular utility to have its own configuration
file.  Thus.  `imap4d' will read `/etc/mailutils.d/imap4d', etc.

3.2.3 Logging Statement
-----------------------

Syntax
------

     logging {
       # Send diagnostics to syslog.
       syslog BOOLEAN;
       # Print message severity levels.
       print-severity BOOLEAN;
       # Output only messages with a severity equal to or
       # greater than this one.
       severity STRING;
       # Set syslog facility.
       facility NAME;
       # Tag syslog messages with this string.
       tag TEXT;
     }

Description
-----------

The `logging' block statement configures where the diagnostic output
goes and how verbose it is.

 -- Configuration: syslog bool
     If `syslog' is set to `yes', the diagnostics will go to syslog.
     Otherwise, it goes to the standard error.

   The default syslog facility is determined at compile time, it can be
inspected using the following command (*note mu info::):

     $ mu info log_facility

 -- Configuration: facility name
     Use syslog facility NAME.  Valid argument values are: `user',
     `daemon', `auth', `authpriv', `mail', `cron', `local0' through
     `local7' (all names case-insensitive), or a facility number.

 -- Configuration: tag text
     Tag syslog messages with TEXT.  By default, program name is used
     as syslog tag.

 -- Configuration: print-severity bool
     Print Mailutils severity name before each message.

 -- Configuration: severity name
     Output only messages with a severity equal to or greater than this
     one.  Valid arguments are: `debug', `info', `notice', `warning',
     `error', `crit', `alert', `emerg',

     }

Description
-----------

The `debug' statement controls the amount of additional debugging
information output by Mailutils programs.  The `level' statement
enables additional debugging information.  Its argument (SPEC) is a
Mailutils debugging specification as described in *note debugging::.

   The `line-info' statement, when set to `true' causes debugging
messages to be prefixed with locations in Mailutils source files where
they appear.  Normally, only Mailutils developers need this option.

3.2.5 Mailbox Statement
-----------------------

Syntax

     mailbox {
       # Use specified URL as a mailspool.
       mail-spool URL;
       # Create mailbox URL using PATTERN.
       mailbox-pattern PATTERN;
       # Default mailbox type.
       mailbox-type TYPE;
       # Default user mail folder.
       folder DIR;
     }

Description
-----------

The `mailbox' statement configures the location, name and type of user
mailboxes.

   The mailbox location can be specified using `mail-spool' or
`mail-pattern' statements.

 -- Configuration: mail-spool PATH
     The `mail-spool' statement specifies directory that holds user
     mailboxes.  Once this statement is given, the `libmailutils'
     library will assume that the mailbox of user LOGIN is kept in file
     `PATH/LOGIN'.

     Historically, PATH can contain mailbox type prefix, e.g.:
     `maildir:///var/spool/mail', but such usage is discouraged in
     favor of `mailbox-pattern' statement.

 -- Configuration: mailbox-pattern PATTERN
     The `mailbox-pattern' statement is a modern way of configuring
     mailbox locations.  It supersedes `mail-spool' statement.

     The PATTERN is valid "mailbox URL", which may contain references
     to `user' macro-variable (see macro-variables (*Editor's note:
     dangling link*) ).  This macro-variable will be expanded to the
     actual user name.  The full syntax for PATTERN is:

            [TYPE://]PATH[;ARGS]

     where:

    TYPE
          Specifies the mailbox type.  It must be one of mailbox types,
          supported by Mailutils.  See Mailbox URLs (*Editor's note:
          dangling link*) .  By default, `local' is assumed.

          *Editor's note:* Verify this
          .

    PATH
          The path pattern.

    ARGS
          A semicolon-separated list of optional arguments, configuring
          indexed directory structure.

          An "indexed directory structure" is a special way of storing
          mailboxes, which allows for faster access in case of very
          large number of users.

          By default, all user mailboxes are stored in a single
          directory and are named after user login names.  To find the
          mailbox for a given user, the system scans the directory for
          the corresponding file.  This usually implies linear search,
          so the time needed to locate a mailbox is directly
          proportional to the ordinal number of the mailbox in the
          directory.

          GNU Mailutils supports three types of indexed directories:
          `direct', `reverse', and `hashed'.

          In direct indexed directory structure, PATH contains 26
          subdirectories named with lower-case letters of Latin
          alphabet.  The location of the user mailbox is determined
          using the following algorithm:

            1. Take the first letter of the user name.

            2. Map it to a lower-case letter using "index mapping"
               table.  The result gives sub-directory name.

            3. Descend into this directory.

          For example, using this algorithm, the mailbox of the user
          `smith' is stored in file `PATH/s/smith'.

          If each of single-letter subdirectories contains the indexed
          directory structure, we have second level of indexing.  In
          this case the file name of `smith''s mailbox is
          `PATH/s/m/smith'.

          The "reverse" indexed structure uses the same principles, but
          the indexing letters are taken from the _end_ of the user
          name, instead of from the beginning.  For example, in the 2nd
          level reverse indexed structure, the `smith''s mailbox is
          located in `PATH/h/t/smith'.

          Finally, the "hashed" structure consists of 256 subdirectories
          under PATH, named by 2-letter hex codes from `00' to `FF'.
          Mailboxes are stored in these subdirectories.  The name of
          the subdirectory is computed by hashing first LEVEL letters
          of the user name.  The hashing algorithm is:

            1. Take next letter from the user name

            2. Add its ASCII value to the hash sum.

            3. Continue (1-2) until LEVEL letters are processed, or all
               letters from the file name are used, whichever occurs
               first.

            4. Convert the computed sum modulo 256 to a hex code.

          Indexed directory structures are configured using the
          following arguments:

         type=VALUE
               Specifies type of indexing.  Valid values are `index',
               for direct indexed structure, `rev-index' for reverse
               indexing, and `hash' for hashed structure.

         param=NUMBER
               Specifies indexing level.

         user=STRING
               Specifies indexing key.  The only meaningful value, as
               of Mailutils version 2.99.98 is `user=${user}'.

          Let's assume the traditional mail layout, in which user
          incoming mails are stored in UNIX mailbox format in
          `/var/mail' directory.  The `mailbox-pattern' for this case
          is:

                 mailbox-pattern "/var/mail/${user}";

          It is entirely equivalent to specifying `mail-spool
          "/var/mail"'.

          Now, if the layout is the same, but mailboxes are kept in
          `maildir' format, then the corresponding statement is:

                 mailbox-pattern "maildir:///var/mail/${user}";

          Finally, if the mailboxes are stored in a directly-indexed
          directory with two levels of indexing, than:

                 mailbox-pattern "maildir:///var/mail;type=index;param=2;user=${user}";

   If neither `mailbox-pattern' nor `mail-spool' are given, the mailbox
names are determined using the following algorithm:

  1. If environment variable `FOLDER' its value is used.

  2. Otherwise, if environment variable `MAIL' is set, its value is
     used.

  3. If neither of these is set, the mailbox name is constructed by
     concatenating the built-in mail spool directory name, a directory
     separator, and the user name.

     The built-in mail spool directory name is determined at compile
     time, using `_PATH_MAILDIR' define from the include file
     `paths.h'.  If this value is not defined, `/var/mail' or
     `/usr/spool/mail' is used.

 -- Configuration: mailbox-type TYPE
     Specifies type of mailboxes.  By default, `mbox' (UNIX mailbox) is
     assumed.  This can be changed while configuring the package by
     setting `MU_DEFAULT_SCHEME' configuration variable.  The default
     value can be verified by running `mailutils-config --info scheme'.

 -- Configuration: folder DIR
     Sets user mail folder directory.  Its value is using when expanding
     `plus-notation', i.e. such mailbox names as `+inbox'.  The `+'
     sign is replaced by DIR, followed by a directory separator (`/').

     The DIR argument can contain mailbox type prefix, e.g `mh://Mail'.

     The default folder name is `Mail/'.

       expire-timeout NUMBER;
       # Use PROG as external locker program.
       external-locker PROG;
     }

Description
-----------

This block statement configures various parameters used when locking
UNIX mailboxes in order to prevent simultaneous writes.

   It is important to note, that locking applies only to maildrops in
UNIX mailbox format.  All other mailbox types do not require locking.

 -- Configuration: flags STRING
     Set locking flags.  Argument is a string consisting of one or more
     of the following letters:

    E
          Use an external program to manage locks.  The program is
          given by `external-locker' statement (see below).

    R
          If the locking attempt failed, retry it.  This is the
          default.  The number of retries, and time interval between
          the two successive attempts is given by `retry-count' and
          `retry-timeout' statements, correspondingly.

    T
          If a lock file exists, check its modification time and, if it
          is older than a predefined amount of time, remove the lock.
          The amount of time is specified by `expire-timeout' statement.

    P
          Store the PID of the locking process in a lock file.

 -- Configuration: retry-count NUMBER
     Number of locking attempts.  The `P' flag must be set for this to
     take effect.

 -- Configuration: retry-timeout SECONDS
     Time interval, in seconds, between the two successive locking
     attempts.  The `P' flag must be set for this to take effect.

 -- Configuration: expire-timeout SECONDS
     Remove existing lock file, if it is created more than this number
     of seconds ago.  The `T' flag must be set for this to take effect.

 -- Configuration: external-locker STRING

3.2.7 Mailer Statement
----------------------

Syntax
------

     mailer {
       url URL;
     }

Description
-----------

A "mailer" is a special logical entity GNU Mailutils uses for sending
messages.  Its internal representation is discussed in  Mailer
(*Editor's note: dangling link*) .  The `mailer' statement configures
it.

   The mailer statement contains a single sub-statement:

 -- Configuration: url STR
     Set the mailer URL.

   GNU Mailutils supports two types of mailer URLs, described in the
table below.  As usual, square brackets indicate optional parts:

smtp://HOST[:PORT]
     Use an SMTP server HOST to send messages.  Optional PORT specifies
     port number or symbolic name (as defined in `/etc/services').  It
     defaults to 25.  The HOST can be specified as either an IP address
     in dotted-quad notation or as a symbolic host name.  In the latter
     case, DNS system will be used to resolve it.

sendmail://PROGNAME
     Use sendmail-compatible program PROGNAME.  "Sendmail-compatible"
     means that the program must support following command line options:

    `-oi'
          Do not treat `.' as message terminator.

    `-f ADDR'
          Use ADDR as the sender address.

    `-t'
          Get recipient addresses from the message.

sendmail:
     This is a special form of the `sendmail' mailer.  It uses the
     `sendmail' binary from the `_PATH_SENDMAIL' macro in your
     `/usr/include/paths.h'.  It is the default mailer.

prog://PROGNAME?QUERY
     A "prog" mailer.  This is a generalization of `sendmail' mailer
     that allows to use arbitrary external programs as mailers.

     The PROGNAME must be a full pathname of the binary file.  When
     sending message, Mailutils will invoke this file with the arguments
     specified by QUERY and will pipe the message to be sent to its
     standard input.

     The QUERY part is a list of arguments, separated by `&' signs.
     Arguments may contain the following macro-substitutions:

    `${sender}'
          Expands to the sender email address.

    `${rcpt}'
          Expands to the recipient email addresses.

3.2.8 ACL Statement
-------------------

Syntax
------

     acl {
       # Allow connections from this IP address.
       allow [from] IP;
       # Deny connections from this IP address.
       deny [from] IP;
       # Log connections from this IP address.
       log [from] IP [STRING];
       /* Execute supplied program if a connection from this
          IP address is requested. */
       exec [from] IP PROGRAM;
       /* Use PROGRAM to decide whether to allow connection
          from IP. */
       ifexec [from] IP PROGRAM;
     }

Description
-----------

The ACL statement defines an "Access Control List", a special structure
that controls who can access the given Mailutils resource.

   The `acl' block contains a list of access controls.  Each control
can be regarded as a function that returns a tree-state value: `True',
`False' and `Don't know'.  When a remote party connects to the server,
each of controls is tried in turn.  If a control returns `False',
access is denied.  If it returns `True', access is allowed.  If it
returns `Don't know', then the next control is tried.  It is unclear
whether to allow access if the last control in list returned `Don't
know'.  GNU Mailutils 2.99.98 issues a warning message and allows
access.  This default may change in future versions.  Users are advised
to write their ACLs so that the last control returns a definitive answer
(either `True' or `False').

   In the discussion below, wherever IP appears as an argument, it can
be replaced by any of:

   * An IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

   * An IPv6 address in numeric notation

   * A CIDR in the form `IP/MASK', where IP is an IP address (either
     IPv4 or IPv6), and MASK is the network mask.

   * A symbolic host name.  

   * A word `any', which matches any IP address.

   The following controls are understood:

 -- Configuration: allow [from] CIDR
     Allow connections from IP addresses matching this CIDR block.

 -- Configuration: deny [from] CIDR
     Deny connections from IP addresses matching this CIDR block.

 -- Configuration: ifexec [from] CIDR PROGRAM
     When a connection from the CIDR block is requested, execute the
     program PROGRAM.  If its exit code is `0', then allow connection.
     Otherwise, deny it.

   The following two controls are provided for logging purposes and as a
means of extensions.  They always return a `Don't know' answer, and
therefore should not be used at the end of an ACL:

 -- Configuration: log [from] CIDR [STRING]
     Log connections from addresses in this CIDR.  The `MU_DIAG_INFO'
     channel is used.  If the logging goes to syslog, it is translated
     to the `LOG_INFO' priority.

     If STRING is not given, the format of the log entry depends on the
     connection family, as described in the table below:

    {AF_INET IP:PORT}
          For inet IPv4 connections.  The variables IP and PORT are
          replaced by the remote IP address and port number,
          correspondingly.

    {AF_UNIX}
          For connections over UNIX sockets.  The socket name, if
          available, may be printed before the closing curly brace.

     If the STRING is specified, it undergoes macro expansion and the
     result of it is used as the log entry.  The following macro
     variables are expanded:

    `aclno'
          Ordinal number of the control in the ACL.  Numbers begin from
          `0'.

    `family'
          Connection family.  Mailutils version 2.99.98 supports two
          families: `AF_INET' and `AF_UNIX'.

    `address'
          Remote IP address (for `AF_INET') or socket name (for
          `AF_UNIX').  Notice that most Unixes return empty string
          instead of the `AF_UNIX' socket name, so do not rely on it.

    `port'
          Remote port number (for `AF_INET').

     For example, the following ACL makes a Mailutils server log every
     incoming connection:

            acl {
               log from any "Connect from ${address}";
               ...
            }

     This was the default behavior for the versions of Mailutils up to
     `1.2', so if you got used to its logs you might wish to add the
     above in your configuration files.

 -- Configuration: exec [from] CIDR PROGRAM
     If a connection from the CIDR block is requested, execute the
     given PROGRAM.  Do not wait for it to terminate, and ignore its
     exit code.

Syntax
------

     tcp-wrappers {
       # Enable TCP wrapper access control.

       # Log denied accesses at this syslog priority.
       deny-syslog-priority PRIO;
     }

3.2.10 Description
------------------

The `tcp-wrappers' statements provides an alternative way to control
accesses to the resources served by GNU Mailutils.  This statement is
enabled if Mailutils is compiled with TCP wrappers library `libwrap'.

   Access control using TCP wrappers is based on two files, called
"tables", containing access rules.  There are two tables: the "allow
table", usually stored in file `/etc/hosts.allow', and the "deny
table", kept in file `/etc/hosts.deny'.  The rules in each table begin
with an identifier called "daemon name".  Each utility wishing to
verify a connection, select the entries having its daemon name from the
allow table.  A connection is allowed if it matches any of these
entries.  Otherwise, the utility retrieves all entries with its daemon
name from the deny table.  If any of these matches the connection, then
it is refused.  Otherwise, if neither table contains matching entries,
the connection is allowed.

   Description of a TCP wrapper table format lies outside the scope of
this document.  Please, see *note ACCESS CONTROL FILES:
(hosts_access(5))ACCESS CONTROL FILES, for details.

 -- Configuration: enable BOOL
     Enable access control using TCP wrappers.  It is on by default.

 -- Configuration: daemon NAME
     Set daemon name for TCP wrapper lookups.  By default, the name of
     the utility is used.  E.g.  `imap4d' uses `imap4d' as the daemon
     name.

 -- Configuration: allow-table FILE
     Use FILE as allow table.  By default, `/etc/hosts.allow' is used.

 -- Configuration: deny-table FILE
     Use FILE as negative table.  By default, `/etc/hosts.deny' is used.

 -- Configuration: allow-syslog-priority PRIO;
     Log allowed accesses using syslog priority PRIO.

 -- Configuration: deny-syslog-priority PRIO;
     Log denied accesses using syslog priority PRIO.

3.2.11 Server Settings
----------------------

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

GNU Mailutils offers several server applications: `pop3d', `imap4d',
`comsatd', to name a few.  Being quite different in their purpose, they
are very similar in some aspects of their architecture.  First of all,
they all support two operating mode: a "daemon" mode, where a program
disconnects from the controlling terminal and works in background, and
an "inetd" mode, where it remains in foreground and communicates with
the remote party via standard input and output streams.  Secondly, when
operating as daemons, they listen to a preconfigured set of IP
addresses and ports, reacting to requests that arrive.

   To configure these aspects of functionality, GNU Mailutils provides
"Server Configuration Settings", which we will describe in this
subsection.

* General Server Configuration::
* Server Statement::

     # Set idle timeout.
     timeout TIME;

Description: These statements configure general server-related issues.

 -- Configuration: mode STRING;
     Set operation mode of the server.  Two operation modes are
     supported:

    daemon
          Run as a standalone daemon, disconnecting from the controlling
          terminal and continuing to run in the background.  In this
          case, it is the server that controls what IP addresses and
          ports to listen on, who is allowed to connect and from where,
          how many clients are allowed to connect simultaneously, etc.
          Most remaining configuration statements are valid only in the
          daemon mode.

          This is the preferred mode of operation for GNU Mailutils
          servers.

    inetd
          Operate as a subprocess of UNIX internet super-server program,
          `inetd'.  *Note Internet super-server: (inetd(8))Internet
          super-server, for a detailed description of the operation of
          `inetd' and its configuration.  In this case it is `inetd'
          that controls all major connectivity aspects, the Mailutils
          server itself communicates with it via standard input and
          output streams.

          For historical reasons, this mode is the default, if no `mode'
          statement is specified.  This will change in the future.

 -- Configuration: foreground BOOL;
     [daemon mode only]
     Do not disconnect from the controlling terminal and remain in the
     foreground.

 -- Configuration: max-children NUMBER;
     [daemon mode only]
     Set maximum number of child processes allowed to run
     simultaneously.  This equals the number of clients that can use
     the server simultaneously.

     The default is 20 clients.

 -- Configuration: pidfile FILE;
     After startup, store the PID of the main server process in FILE.
     When the process terminates, the file is removed.  As of version
     2.99.98, GNU Mailutils servers make no further use of this file.
     It is intended for use by automated startup scripts and
     controlling programs (see mention pies (*Editor's note: dangling
     link*) ).

 -- Configuration: port PORTSPEC;
     [daemon mode only]
     Set default port to listen to.  The PORTSPEC argument is either a
     port number in decimal, or a symbolic service name, as listed in
     `/etc/services' (*note Internet network services list:
     (services(5))Internet network services list.).

 -- Configuration: timeout TIME;
     Set maximum idle time out in seconds.  If a client does not send
     any requests during TIME seconds, the child process terminates.

Syntax:
     server IPADDR[:PORT] {
       # Run this server as a single process.
       single-process BOOL;
       # Log the session transcript.
       transcript BOOL;
       # Set idle timeout.
       timeout TIME;
       # Set server specific ACLs.
       acl { /* *Note ACL Statement::. */ };
     }

Description: The `server' block statement configures a single TCP or UDP
server.  It takes effect only in daemon mode (*note server mode::).
The argument to this statement specifies the IP address, and,
optionally, the port, to listen on for requests.  The IPADDR part is
either an IPv4 address in dotted-quad form, or a symbolic host name
which can be resolved to such an address via DNS.  Specifying `0.0.0.0'
as the IPADDR means listen on all available network interfaces.  The
PORT argument is either a port number in decimal, or a symbolic service
name, as listed in `/etc/services' (*note Internet network services
list: (services(5))Internet network services list.).  If PORT is
omitted, Mailutils uses the port set by `port' statement (*note port:
General Server Configuration.), or, in its absence, the default port
number, which depends on a server being used (e.g. 110, for `pop3d',
143, for `imap4d', etc.).

   Any number of `server' statements may be specified in a single
configuration file, allowing to set up the same service on several IP
addresses and/or port numbers, and with different configurations.

   Statements within the `server' block statement configure this
particular server.

 -- Configuration: single-process BOOL;
     If set to true, this server will operate in single-process mode.
     This mode is intended for debugging only, do not use it on
     production servers.

 -- Configuration: transcript BOOL;
     Enable transcript of the client-server interaction.  This may
     generate excessive amounts of logging, which in turn may slow down
     the operation considerably.

     Session transcripts are useful in fine-tuning your configurations
     and in debugging.  They should be turned off on most production
     servers.

 -- Configuration: timeout TIME;
     Set idle timeout for this server.  This overrides global timeout
     settings (*note timeout: General Server Configuration.).

 -- Configuration: acl
     This statement defines a per-server Access Control List.  Its
     syntax is as described in *note ACL Statement::.  Per-server ACLs
     complement, but not override, global ACLs, i.e. if both global ACL
     and per-server ACL are used, the connection is allowed only if
     both of them allow it, and is denied if any one of them denies it.

       authentication MODULE-LIST;
       # Set a list of modules for authorization.
       authorization MODULE-LIST;
     }

Description
-----------

Some mail utilities provide access to their services only after
verifying that the user is actually the person he is claiming to be.
Such programs are, for example, `pop3d' and `imap4d'.  The process of
the verification is broken down into two stages: "authorization" and
"authentication".  In "authorization" stage the program retrieves the
information about a particular user.  In "authentication" stage, this
information is compared against the user-supplied credentials.  Only if
both stages succeed is the user allowed to use the service.

   A set of "modules" is involved in performing each stage.  For
example, the authorization stage can retrieve the user description from
various sources: system database, SQL database, virtual domain table,
etc.  Each module is responsible for retrieving the description from a
particular source of information.  The modules are arranged in a
"module list".  The modules from the list are invoked in turn, until
one of them succeeds or the list is exhausted.  In the latter case the
authorization fails.  Otherwise, the data returned by the succeeded
module are used in authentication.

   Similarly, authentication may be performed in several ways.  The
authentication modules are also grouped in a list.  Each module is
tried in turn until either a module succeeds, in which case the
authentication succeeds, or the end of the list is reached.

   For example, the authorization list

       (system, sql, virtdomains)

means that first the system user database (`/etc/password') is searched
for a description of a user in question.  If the search fails, the SQL
database is searched.  Finally, if it also fails, the search is
performed in the virtual domain database.

   _Note_, that some authentication and/or authorization modules may be
disabled when configuring the package before compilation.  The names of
the disabled modules are nevertheless available for use in runtime
configuration options, but they represent a "fail-only" functionality,
e.g. if the package was compiled without SQL support then the module
`sql' in the above example will always fail, thus passing the execution
on to the next module.

   The `auth' statement configures authentication and authorization.

 -- Configuration: authorization MODULE-LIST
     Define a sequence of modules to use for authorization.  Modules
     will be tried in the same order as listed in MODULE-LIST.

     The modules available for use in authorization list are:

    system
          User credentials are retrieved from the system user database
          (`/etc/password').

    sql
          User credentials are retrieved from a SQL database.  A
          separate configuration statement, `sql', is used to configure
          it (*note SQL Statement::).

    virtdomain
          User credentials are retrieved from a "virtual domain" user
          database.  Virtual domains are configured using `virtdomain'
          statement (*note Virtdomain Statement::).

    radius
          User credentials are retrieved using RADIUS.  *Note Radius
          Statement::, for a detailed description on how to configure
          it.

    ldap
          User credentials are retrieved from an LDAP database.  *Note
          LDAP Statement::, for an information on how to configure it.


     *Editor's note:* This may be inaccurate:

     Unless overridden by `authorization' statement, the default list
     of authorization modules is:

            (system, sql, virtdomains)

 -- Configuration: authentication MODULE-LIST
     Define a sequence of modules to use for authentication.  Modules
     will be tried in the same order as listed in MODULE-LIST.

     The following table lists modules available for use in MODULE-LIST:

    generic
          The generic authentication type.  User password is hashed and
          compared against the hash value returned in authorization
          stage.

    system
          The hashed value of the user password is retrieved from
          `/etc/shadow' file on systems that support it.

    sql
          The hashed value of the user password is retrieved from a SQL
          database using query supplied by `getpass' statement (*note
          getpass: SQL Statement.).

    pam
          The user is authenticated via pluggable authentication module
          (PAM).  The PAM service name to be used is configured in
          `pam' statement (*note PAM Statement::).

    radius
          The user is authenticated on a remote RADIUS server.  *Note
          Radius Statement::.

    ldap
          The user is authenticated using LDAP.  *Note LDAP Statement::.

     virtdomain {
       # Name of the virtdomain password directory.
       passwd-dir DIR;

Description
-----------

"Virtual mail domains" make it possible to handle several mail domains
each having a separate set of users, on a single server.  The domains
are completely independent of each other, i.e. the same user name can
be present in several domains and represent different users.

   When authenticating to a server with virtual domain support enabled,
users must supply their user names with domain parts.  The server strips
off the domain part and uses it as a name of UNIX-format password
database file, located in the "domain password directory".  The latter
is set using `passwd-dir' statement.

 -- Configuration: passwd-dir DIR
     Set virtual domain password directory.

   For example, when authenticating user `smith@domain.tld', the server
will use password file named `DIR/domain.tld'.  This file must be in
UNIX passwd format (*note password file: (passwd(5))password file.),
with encrypted passwords stored in it (as of GNU Mailutils version
2.99.98, there is no support for shadow files in virtual password
directories, although this is planned for future versions).  Here is an
example record from this file:

     smith:Wbld/G2Q2Le2w:1000:1000:Email Account:/var/mail/domain/smith:/dev/null

   Notice, that it must contain user names without domain parts.

   The `pw_dir' field (the 6th field) is used to determine the location
of the maildrop for this user.  It is defined as `PW_DIR/INBOX'.  In
our example, the maildrop for user `smith' will be located in file
`/var/mail/domain/smith'.

   If user did not supply his domain name, or if no matching record was
found in the password file, or if the file matching the domain name
does not exist, then GNU Mailutils falls back to alternative method.
First, it tries to determine the IP address of the remote party.  Then
the domain name corresponding to that address is looked up in the DNS
system.  Finally, this domain name is used as a name of the password
file.

   Mailutils uses GNU Radius library, which is configured via
`raddb/client.conf' file (*note Client Configuration:

settings that were used while compiling GNU Radius.  Usually it is
`/usr/local/etc', or `/etc'.  This default can also be changed at run
time using `directory' statement:

 -- Configuration: directory DIR
     Set full path name to the GNU Radius configuration directory.

   It authorization is used, the Radius dictionary file must declare the
the following attributes:

Attribute                     Type           Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
GNU-MU-User-Name              string         User login name
GNU-MU-UID                    integer        UID
GNU-MU-GID                    integer        GID
GNU-MU-GECOS                  string         GECOS
GNU-MU-Dir                    string         Home directory
GNU-MU-Shell                  string         User shell
GNU-MU-Mailbox                string         User mailbox
GNU-MU-Quota                  integer        Mail quota (in bytes)

   A dictionary file with appropriate definitions is included in the
Mailutils distribution: `examples/config/mailutils.dict'.  This file is
not installed by default, you will have to manually copy it to the GNU
Radius `raddb/dict' directory and include it in the main dictionary
file `raddb/dictionary' by adding the following statement:

     $INCLUDE dict/mailutils.dict

   Requests to use for authentication and authorization are configured
using three statements: `auth', `getpwnam' and `getpwuid'.  Each
statement takes a single argument: a string, containing a
comma-separated list of assignments.  An assignment specifies a
particular "attribute-value pair" (*note RADIUS Attributes:
(radius)Overview.) to send to the server.  The left-hand side of the
assignment is a symbolic attribute name, as defined in one of Radius
dictionaries (*note Dictionary of Attributes: (radius)dictionary
file.).  The value is specified by the right-hand side of assignment.
For example:

     "Service-Type = Authenticate-Only, NAS-Identifier = \"mail\""

   An assignment may contain references to the following macro-variables
(see macro-variables (*Editor's note: dangling link*) ):

user
     The actual user name (for `auth' and `getpwnam'), or user ID (for
     `getpwuid').  For example:

          User-Name = ${user}

passwd
     User password.  For examples:
          User-Password = ${passwd}

 -- Configuration: auth PAIRLIST
     Specifies the request to be sent to authenticate the user.  For
     example:

          auth "User-Name = ${user}, User-Password = ${passwd}";

     The user is authenticated only if this request returns
     `Access-Accept' (*note Access-Accept: (radius)Authentication
     Requests.).  Any returned attribute-value pairs are ignored.

 -- Configuration: getpwnam PAIRLIST
     Specifies the request that returns user information for the given
     user name.  For example:

          getpwnam "User-Name = ${user}, State = getpwnam, "
                   "Service-Type = Authenticate-Only";

     If the requested user account exists, the Radius server must return
     `Access-Accept' packet with the following attributes:
     `GNU-MU-User-Name', `GNU-MU-UID', `GNU-MU-GID', `GNU-MU-GECOS',
     `GNU-MU-Dir', `GNU-MU-Shell'.

     The attributes `GNU-MU-Mailbox' and `GNU-MU-Quota' are optional.

     If `GNU-MU-Mailbox' is present, it must contain a valid mailbox
     URL (see urls (*Editor's note: dangling link*) ).  If
     `GNU-MU-Mailbox' is not present, Mailutils constructs the mailbox
     name using the settings from the `mailbox' configuration statement
     (*note Mailbox Statement::), or built-in defaults, if it is not
     present.

     If `GNU-MU-Quota' is present, it specifies the maximum mailbox
     size for this user, in bytes.  In the absence of this attribute,
     mailbox size is unlimited.

 -- Configuration: getpwuid PAIRLIST
     Specifies the request that returns user information for the given
     user ID.  In PAIRLIST, the `user' macro-variable is expanded to
     the numeric value of ID.  For example:

          getpwuid "User-Name = ${user}, State = getpwuid, "
                   "Service-Type = Authenticate-Only";

     The reply to `getpwuid' request is the same as to `getpwnam'
     request (see above).

3.2.17 Description
------------------

The `sql' statement configures access credentials to SQL database and
the queries for authentication and authorization.

   GNU Mailutils supports three types of SQL interfaces: MySQL,
PostgreSQL and ODBC.  The latter is a standard API for using database
management systems, which can be used to communicate with a wide
variety of DBMS.

 -- Configuration: interface TYPE
     Configures type of DBMS interface.  Allowed values for TYPE are:

    mysql
          Interface with a MySQL server (`http://www.mysql.org').

    odbc
          Use ODBC interface.  See `http://www.unixodbc.org', for a
          detailed description of ODBC configuration.

    postgres
          Interface with a PostgreSQL server
          (`http://www.postgres.org').

   The database and database access credentials are configured using the
following statements:

 -- Configuration: host ARG
     The host running the SQL server.  The value can be either a host
     name or an IP address in dotted-quad notation, in which case an
     INET connection is used, or a full pathname to a file, in which
     case a connection to UNIX socket is used.

 -- Configuration: port ARG
     TCP port the server is listening on (for INET connections).  This
     parameter is optional.  Its default value depends on the type of
     database being used.

 -- Configuration: db ARG;
     Name of the database.

 -- Configuration: user ARG
     SQL user name.

 -- Configuration: passwd ARG;
     Password to access the database.

3.3 Debugging
=============

`Mailutils' debugging output is controlled by a set of levels, each of
which can be set independently of others.  Each debug level consists of
a "category name", which identifies the part of `Mailutils' for which
additional debugging is desired, and a level number, which tells
`Mailutils' how verbose should its output be.

   Valid debug levels are:

error
     Displays error conditions which are normally not reported, but
     passed to the caller layers for handling.

trace0 through trace9
     Ten levels of verbosity, `trace0' producing less output, `trace9'
     producing the maximum amount of output.

prot
     Displays network protocol interaction, where applicable.

   Implementation and applicability of each level differs between
various categories.  The full list of categories is available in file
`libmailutils/diag/debcat' in the Mailutils source tree.  Most useful
categories and levels implemented for them are discussed later in this
article.

* Menu:

* Level Syntax::
* Level BNF::
* Debugging Categories::


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Level Syntax,  Next: Level BNF,  Up: debugging

3.3.1 Level Syntax
------------------

Debug levels can be set either from the command line, by using the
`--debug-level' command line option, or from the configuration file,
using the `.debug.level' statement.  In both cases, the level is
specified as a list of individual levels, delimited with semicolons.
Each individual level can be specified as:

!CATEGORY
     Disables all levels for the specified CATEGORY.

CATEGORY
     Enables all levels for the specified CATEGORY.

CATEGORY.LEVEL
     For the given CATEGORY, enables all levels from `error' to LEVEL,
     inclusive.

CATEGORY.=LEVEL
     Enables only the given LEVEL for this CATEGORY.

CATEGORY.!LEVEL
     Disables all levels from `error' to LEVEL, inclusive, for this
     CATEGORY.

CATEGORY.!=LEVEL
     Disables only the given LEVEL in this CATEGORY.

CATEGORY.LEVELA-LEVELB
     Enables all levels in the range from LEVELA to LEVELB, inclusive.

CATEGORY.!LEVELA-LEVELB
     Disables all levels in the range from LEVELA to LEVELB, inclusive.

   Additionally, a comma-separated list of level specifications is
allowed after the dot.  For example, the following specification:

     acl.prot,!=trace9,!trace2

   enables in category `acl' all levels, except `trace9', `trace0',
`trace1', and `trace2'.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Level BNF,  Next: Debugging Categories,  Prev: Level Syntax,  Up: debugging

3.3.2 BNF
---------

The following specification in Backus-Naur form describes formally the
Mailutils debug level:

     <debug-spec> ::= <level-spec> | <debug-level-list>
     <debug-level-list> ::= <debug-level> |
                            <debug-level-list> ";" <debug-level>
     <debug-level> ::= <category> | "!" <category> |
                       <category> "." <level-list>
     <level-list> ::= <level-spec> | <level-list> "," <level-spec>
     <level-spec> ::=  <level> | <negate-level>
     <negate-level> ::= "!" <level>
     <level> ::= <level-number> | "=" <level-number> |
                 <level-number> "-" <level-number>
     <level-number> ::= "error" | "trace0" | "trace1" | "trace2" | "trace3" |
                        "trace4" | "trace5" | "trace6" | "trace7" |
                        "trace8" | "trace9" | "prot"


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Debugging Categories,  Prev: Level BNF,  Up: debugging

3.3.3 Debugging Categories
--------------------------

acl
     This category enables debugging of Access Control Lists.  Available
     levels are:

    error
          As usual, displays errors, not directly reported otherwise.

    trace0
          Basic tracing of ACL processing.

    trace9
          Traces the process of matching the ACL conditions.

config
     This category affects configuration parser and/or lexical
     analyzer.  The following levels are supported:

    trace0
          Minimal information about configuration statements.

    trace2
          Trace lexical structure of the configuration files.

    trace7
          Trace execution of the configuration parser.

     Due to its specific nature, this category cannot be enabled from
     the configuration file.  A special hook is provided to facilitate
     debugging the configuration parser, namely, a pragmatic comment in
     form:

          #debug=DEBUG-LEVEL-LIST

     causes DEBUG-LEVEL-LIST to be parsed as described above.  Thus, to
     force debugging of the configuration parser, one would add the
     following line at the very beginning of the configuration file:

          #debug=config.trace7

mailbox
     Operations over mailboxes.  This module supports the following
     levels: `error', `trace0', `trace1', and `prot'.  The latter is
     used by remote mailbox support libraries.

auth
     Enables debugging information about authentication and
     authorization.  This category supports the following levels:
     `error', `trace0', `trace1', and `trace2'.

     In level `trace0', user data are reported along with the "data
     source" they were obtained from.  The output may look like this:

          pop3d: source=system, name=gray, passwd=x, uid=120, gid=100,
          gecos=Sergey Poznyakoff, dir=/home/gray, shell=/bin/bash,
          mailbox=/var/mail/gray, quota=0, change_uid=1

     In the `trace1' level, additional flow traces are displayed.

     In the level `trace2', a detailed flow trace is displayed, which
     looks like the following:

          pop3d: Trying generic...
          pop3d: generic yields 38=Function not implemented
          pop3d: Trying system...
          pop3d: system yields 0=Success
          pop3d: Trying generic...
          pop3d: generic yields 4135=Authentication failed
          pop3d: Trying system...
          pop3d: system yields 0=Success

mailer
     Debugs mailer operations.  The following levels are supported:

    error
          Displays mild error conditions.

    trace0
          Traces mailer operations in general: displays what part of
          the message is being sent, etc.

    trace6
          When used together with `prot', displays security-sensitive
          information (such as passwords, user keys, etc). in
          plaintext.  By default, such information is replaced with
          asteriscs to reduce the possibility of security compromise.

    trace7
          When used together with `prot', displays the "payload"
          information as it is being sent.  The "payload" is the actual
          message contents, i.e. the part of SMTP transaction that goes
          after the `DATA' command and which ends with a terminating
          dot line.  Setting this level can generate huge amounts of
          information.

    prot
          For SMTP mailer: outputs transcripts of SMTP sessions.

     _Note:_ Unless in a very secure environment, it is advised to
     avoid using level settings such as mailer.prot or mailer (without
     explicit level part), because the resulting output tends to be
     extremely copious and reveals sender private and security-sensitive
     data.  If you wish to trace SMTP session flow, use `mailer.=prot'
     or at least `mailer.prot,!trace6'.

serve
     This category provides debugging information for Mailutils IP
     server objects.  It supports the `error' and `trace0' levels.

folder
     This category controls debugging information shown for operations
     related to Mailutils folders.

remote
     The remote category is used by `imap4d' and `pop3d' servers to
     request showing additional information in the session transcripts.
     This category takes effect only when the `transcript'
     configuration variable is set.  Valid levels are:

    trace6
          Show security-sensitive information (user passwords, etc.)

    trace7
          Show payload information

3.4 `frm' and `from' -- List Headers from a Mailbox
===================================================

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

GNU mailutils provides two commands for listing messages in a mailbox.
These are `from' and `frm'.

   The behavior of both programs is affected by the following
configuration file statements:

Statement              Reference
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
debug                  *Note Debug Statement::.
tls                    *Note TLS Statement::.
mailbox                *Note Mailbox Statement::.
locking                *Note Locking Statement::.

`frm'
-----

The `frm' utility outputs a header information of the selected messages
in a mailbox.  By default, `frm' reads user's system mailbox and
outputs the contents of `From' and `Subject' headers for each message.
If a folder is specified in the command line, the program reads that
folder rather than the default mailbox.

   The following command line options alter the behavior of the program:

`-d'
`--debug'
     Enable debugging output.

`-f STRING'
`--field STRING'
     Display the header named by STRING instead of `From' `Subject'
     pair.

`-l'
`--to'
     Include the contents of `To' header to the output.  The output
     field order is then: `To' `From' `Subject'.

`-n'
`--number'
     Prefix each line with corresponding message number.

`-Q'
`--Quiet'
     Be very quiet.  Nothing is output except error messages.  This is
     useful in shell scripts where only the return status of the
     program is important.

`-q'
`--query'
     Print a message only if there are unread messages in the mailbox.

`-S'
`--summary'
     Print a summary line.

`-s ATTR'
`--status ATTR'
     Only display headers from messages with the given status.  ATTR
     may be one of the following: `new', `read', `unread'.  It is
     sufficient to specify only first letter of an ATTR.  Multiple `-s'
     options are allowed.

`-t'
`--align'
     Tidy mode.  In this mode `frm' tries to preserve the alignment of
     the output fields.  It also enables the use of BIDI algorithm for
     displaying subject lines that contain text in right-to-left
     orientation (such as Arabic or Hebrew).

`from'
------

The `from' utility displays sender and subject of each message in a
mailbox.  By default, it reads the user's system mailbox.  If the
program is given a single argument, it is interpreted as a name of the
user whose mailbox is to be read.  Obviously, permissions are required
to access that user's mailbox, so such invocations may be used only by
superuser.

   The option `-f' (`--file') instructs `from' to read the given
mailbox.

   The full list of options, supported by `from' follows:

`-c'
`--count'
     Prints only a count of messages in the mailbox and exit.

`-d'
`--debug'
     Prints additional debugging output.

`-s STRING'
`--sender=STRING'
     Prints only mail whose `From:' headers contain the supplied string.

     *Editor's note:* Probably, this should test envelopes as well.

`-f URL'
`--file=URL'
     Examine mailbox from the given URL.

3.5 `mail' -- Send and Receive Mail
===================================

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

`Mail' is an enhanced version of standard `/bin/mail' program.  As well
as its predecessor, it can be used either in sending mode or in reading
mode.  `Mail' enters sending mode when one or more email addresses were
specified in this command line.  In this mode the program waits until
user finishes composing the message, then attempts to send it to the
specified addresses and exits.  See *note Composing Mail::, for a
detailed description of this behavior.

   If the command line contained no email addresses, `mail' switches to
reading mode.  In this mode it allows to read and manipulate the
contents of the user system mailbox.  The `--file' (`-f') command line
option allows to specify another mailbox name.  For more detail, see
*note Reading Mail::.

   In contrast to other GNU Mailutils programs, `mail' does not use the
Mailutils configuration file.  Instead, it uses the traditional
`mailrc'-style configuration.  *Note Mail Configuration Files::, for a
detailed description of its format.

File: mailutils.info,  Node: Invoking Mail,  Next: Specifying Messages,  Up: mail

3.5.1 Invoking `mail'
---------------------

General usage of `mail' program is:

           mail [OPTION...] [ADDRESS...]
   If [ADDRESS...] part is present, `mail' switches to mail sending
mode, otherwise it operates in mail reading mode.

   The program uses following option groups: See mailbox (*Editor's
note: dangling link*) .

   `Mail' understands following command line options:

`-e'
`--exist'
     Return true if the mailbox contains some messages.  Return false
     otherwise.  This is useful for writing shell scripts.

`-E COMMAND'
`--exec=COMMAND'
     Execute COMMAND before opening the mailbox.  Any number of
     `--exec' options can be given.  The commands will be executed
     after sourcing configuration files (*note Mail Configuration
     Files::), but before opening the mailbox.

`-f'
`--file'
     Operate on the mailbox given by the first non-optional command line
     argument.  If there is no such argument, read messages from the
     user's `mbox' file.  *Note Reading Mail::, for more details about
     using this option.

`-F'
`--byname'
     Record outgoing messages in a file named after the first recipient.
     The name is the login-name portion of the address found first on
     the `To:' line in the mail header.  This option sets the `byname'
     variable, which see (*note byname::).

`-H'
`--headers'
     Print header summary to stdout and exit.

`-i'
`--ignore'
     Ignore interrupts.

`-m PATH'
`--mail-spool=PATH'
     Set path to the mailspool directory

`-n'
`--norc'
     Do not read the system-wide mailrc file.  *Note Mail Configuration
     Files::.

`-N'
`--nosum'
     Do not display initial header summary.

`-p'
`--print'
`--read'
     Print all mail to standard output.  It is equivalent to issuing
     following commands after starting `mail -N':
          print *
          quit

`-r ADDRESS'
`--return-address=ADDRESS'
     Sets the return email address for outgoing mail.  *Note
     return-address::.

`-q'
`--quit'
     Cause interrupts to terminate program.

3.5.2 How to Specify Message Sets
---------------------------------

Many mail commands such as print and delete can be given a "message
list" to operate upon.  Wherever the message list is omitted, the
command operates on the current message.

   The "message list" in its simplest form is one of:

.
     Selects current message.  It is equivalent to empty message list.

*
     Selects all messages in the mailbox.

^
     Selects first non-deleted message.

$
     Selects last non-deleted message.

   In its complex form, the "message list" is a comma or
whitespace-separated list of "message specifiers".  A "message
specifier" is one of

Message Number
     This specifier addresses the message with the given ordinal number
     in the mailbox.

Message range
     "Message range" is specified as two message numbers separated by a
     dash.  It selects all messages with the number lying within that
     range.

Attribute specifier
     An "Attribute specifier" is a colon followed by a single letter.
     The "Attribute specifier" addresses all messages in the mailbox
     that have the given attribute.  These are the valid attribute
     specifiers:

    `:d'
          Selects all deleted messages.

    `:n'
          Selects all recent messages, i.e. the messages that have not
          been neither read not seen so far.

    `:o'
          Selects all messages that have been seen.

    `:r'
          Selects all messages that have been read.

    `:u'
          Selects all messages that have _not_ been read.

    `:t'
          Selects all tagged messages.

    `:T'
          Selects all untagged messages.

Header match
     The "header match" is a string in the form:

          [HEADER:]/STRING/
     It selects all messages that contain header field HEADER matching
     given REGEXP.  If the variable `regexp' is set, the STRING is
     assumed to be a POSIX regexp.  Otherwise, a header is considered
     to match STRING if the latter constitutes a substring of the
     former (comparison is case-insensitive).

     If HEADER: part is omitted, it is assumed to be `Subject:'.

Message body match
     The "message body match" is a string in the form:

          :/STRING/
     It selects all messages whose body matches the string.  The
     matching rules are the same as described under "Header match".

   A "message specifier" can be followed by "message part specifier",
enclosed in a pair of brackets.  A "message part specifier" controls
which part of a message should be operated upon.  It is meaningful only
for multipart messages.  A "message part specifier" is a comma or
whitespace - separated list of part numbers or ranges.  Each part
number can in turn be "message part specifier", thus allowing for
operating upon multiply-encoded messages.

   The following are the examples of valid message lists:

3.5.3 Composing Mail
--------------------

You can compose the message by simply typing the contents of it, line
by line.  But usually this is not enough, you would need to edit your
text, to quote some messages, etc.  `Mail' provides these capabilities
through "compose escapes".  The "compose escapes" are single-character
commands, preceded by special "escape character", which defaults to
`~'.  The combination `escape character + command' is recognized as a
compose escape only if it occurs at the beginning of a line.  If the
escape character must appear at the beginning of a line, enter it twice.
The actual escape character may be changed by setting the value of
`escape' mail variable (*note Mail Variables::).

3.5.3.1 Quitting Compose Mode
.............................

There are several commands allowing you to quit the compose mode.

   Typing the end-of-file character (`C-D') on a line alone finishes
compose mode and sends the message to its destination.  The `C-D'
character looses its special meaning if `ignoreeof' mail variable is
set.

   If mail variable `dot' is set, typing dot (`.') on a line alone
achieves the same effect as `C-D' above.

   Finally, using `~.' escape always quits compose mode and sends out
the composed message.

   To abort composing of a message without sending it, type interrupt
character (by default, `C-C') twice.  This behavior is disabled when
mail variable `ignore' is set.  In this case, you can use `~x' escape
to achieve the same effect.

3.5.3.2 Getting Help on Compose Escapes: ~?
...........................................

The `~?' escape prints on screen a brief summary of the available
compose escapes.  _Please note_, that `~h' escape prompts for changing
the header values, and does _not_ give help.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Editing the Message,  Next: Modifying the Headers,  Prev: Getting Help on Compose Escapes,  Up: Composing Mail

3.5.3.3 Editing the Message: ~e and ~v
......................................

If you are not satisfied with the message as it is, you can edit it
using a text editor specified either by `EDITOR' or by `VISUAL'
environment variables.  The `~e' uses the former, and `~v' uses the
latter.

   By default both escapes allow you to edit only the body of the
message.  However, if the `editheaders' variable is set, `mail' will
load into the editor the complete text of the message with headers
included, thus allowing you to change the headers as well.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Modifying the Headers,  Next: Enclosing Another Message,  Prev: Editing the Message,  Up: Composing Mail

3.5.3.4 Modifying the Headers: ~h, ~t, ~c, ~b, ~s
.................................................

To add new addresses to the list of message recipients, use `~t'
command, e.g.:

     ~t name1@domain.net name2

   To add addresses to `Cc' or `Bcc', use `~c' or `~b' escapes
respectively.

   To change the `Subject' header, use `~s' escape, e.g.:

     ~s "Re: your message"

   Finally, to edit all headers, type `~h' escape.  This will present
you with the values of `To', `Cc', `Bcc', and `Subject' headers
allowing to edit them with normal text editing commands.

3.5.3.5 Enclosing Another Message: ~m and ~M
............................................

If you are sending mail from within mail command mode, you can enclose
the contents of any message sent to you by using `~m' or `~M' commands.
Typing `~m' alone will enclose the contents of the current message,
typing `~m 12' will enclose the contents of message #12 and so on.

   The `~m' uses retained and ignored lists when enclosing headers, the
`~M' encloses all header fields.

   In both cases, the contents of `indentprefix' mail variable is
prepended to each line enclosed.

3.5.3.6 Adding a File to the Message: ~r and ~d
...............................................

To append the contents of file FILENAME to the message, type

     ~r FILENAME
   or

     ~< FILENAME
   The `~d' escape is a shorthand for

     ~r dead.letter

3.5.3.7 Printing And Saving the Message
.......................................

The `~p' escape types the contents of the message entered so far,
including headers, on your terminal.  You can save the message to an
arbitrary file using `~w' escape.  It takes the filename as its
argument.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Signing the Message,  Next: Printing Another Message,  Prev: Printing And Saving the Message,  Up: Composing Mail

3.5.3.8 Signing the Message: ~a and ~A
......................................

To save you the effort of typing your signature at the end of each
message, you can use `~a' or `~A' escapes.  If your signature occupies
one line only, save it to the variable `sign' and use `~a' escape to
insert it.  Otherwise, if it is longer than one line, save it to a
file, store the name of this file in the variable `Sign', and use `~A'
escape to insert it into the message.

3.5.3.9 Printing Another Message: ~f and ~F
...........................................

Sometimes it is necessary to view the contents of another message,
while composing.  These two escapes allow it.  Both take the message
list as their argument.  If they are used without argument, the
contents of the current message is printed.  The difference between
`~f' and `~F' is that the former uses ignored and retained lists to
select headers to be displayed, whereas the latter prints all headers.

The `~i' escape enters the value of the named mail variable into the
body of the message being composed.

3.5.3.11 Executing Other Mail Commands: ~: and ~-
.................................................

You can execute a mail command from within compose mode using `~:' or
`~-' escapes.  For example, typing

     ~: from :t
   will display the from lines of all tagged messages.  Note, that
executing mail-sending commands from within the compose mode is not
allowed.  An attempt to execute such a command will result in
diagnostic message "Command not allowed in an escape sequence" being
displayed.  Also, when starting compose mode immediately from the shell
(e.g. running `mail address@domain'), most mail commands are
meaningless, since there is no mailbox to operate upon.  In this case,
the only commands that can reasonably be used are: `alias', `unalias',
`alternate', `set', and `unset'.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Executing Shell Commands,  Prev: Executing Other Mail Commands,  Up: Composing Mail

3.5.3.12 Executing Shell Commands: ~! and ~|
............................................

The `~!' escape executes specified command and returns you to `mail'
compose mode without altering your message.  When used without
arguments, it starts your login shell.  The `~|' escape pipes the
message composed so far through the given shell command and replaces the
message with the output the command produced.  If the command produced
no output, `mail' assumes that something went wrong and retains the old
contents of your message.

3.5.4 Reading Mail
------------------

To read messages from a given mailbox, use one of the following ways of
invoking `mail':

`mail'
     To read messages from your system mailbox.

`mail -f'
`mail --file'
     To read messages from your mailbox (`$HOME/mbox').  If the
     `--user' option (see below) is also given, read messages from that
     user's `mbox'.

`mail -f PATH_TO_MAILBOX'
`mail --file PATH_TO_MAILBOX'
     To read messages from the specified mailbox.

`mail -u USER'

`mail --user=USER'
     To read messages from the system mailbox belonging to USER.

   _Please note_, that usual mailbox permissions won't allow you to use
the last variant of invocation, unless you are a super-user.
Similarly, the last but one variant is also greatly affected by the
permissions the target mailbox has.

   Notice that PATH_TO_MAILBOX is not an argument to `--file' (`-f')
option, but rather the first non-optional argument on the command line.
Therefore, the following three invocations are equivalent:

     $ mail -fin mymbox
     $ mail -f mymbox -in
     $ mail --file -in mymbox
     $ mail --file -i mymbox -n

   Additionally, for conformance to the GNU standards, the following
form is also accepted:

     $ mail --file=mymbox -i -n

   Unless you have started mail with `--norc' command line option, it
will read the contents of the system-wide configuration file.  Then it
reads the contents of user configuration file, if any.  For detailed
description of these files, see *note Mail Configuration Files::.
After this initial setup, `mail' displays the first page of header
lines and enters interactive mode.  In interactive mode, `mail'
displays its prompt (`?', if not set otherwise) and executes the
commands the user enters.

3.5.4.1 Quitting the Program
............................

Following commands quit the program:

`quit'
     Terminates the session.  If `mail' was operating upon user's system
     mailbox, then all undeleted and unsaved messages that have been
     read and are not marked with hold flag are saved to the user's
     mbox file (`$HOME/mbox').  The messages, marked with `delete' are
     removed.  The program exits to the Shell, unless saving the
     mailbox fails, in which case user can escape with the exit command.

`exit'
`ex'
`xit'
     Program exits to the Shell without modifying the mailbox it
     operates upon.

   Typing EOF (`C-D') alone is equivalent to `quit'.

     is updated as if `quit' command has been issued.  If MAILBOX is
     omitted, the command prints the current mailbox name followed by
     the summary information regarding it, e.g.:

          & fold
          "/var/spool/mail/gray": 23 messages 22 unread


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Controlling Header Display,  Next: Displaying Information,  Prev: Changing mailbox/directory,  Up: Reading Mail

3.5.4.5 Controlling Header Display
..................................

To control which headers in the message should be displayed, `mail'
keeps two lists: a "retained" header list and an "ignored" header list.
If "retained" header list is not empty, only the header fields listed
in it are displayed when printing the message.  Otherwise, if "ignored"
header list is not empty, only the headers _not listed_ in this list
are displayed.  The uppercase variants of message-displaying commands
can be used to print all the headers.

   The following commands modify and display the contents of both lists.

`discard [HEADER-FIELD-LIST]'
`di [HEADER-FIELD-LIST]'
`ignore [HEADER-FIELD-LIST]'
`ig [HEADER-FIELD-LIST]'
     Add HEADER-FIELD-LIST to the ignored list.  When used without
     arguments, this command prints the contents of ignored list.

`retain [HEADER-FIELD-LIST]'
`ret [HEADER-FIELD-LIST]'
     Add HEADER-FIELD-LIST to the retained list.  When used without
     arguments, this command prints the contents of retained list.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Displaying Information,  Next: Displaying Messages,  Prev: Controlling Header Display,  Up: Reading Mail

3.5.4.6 Displaying Information
..............................

`='
     Displays the current message number.

`headers [MSGLIST]'
`h [MSGLIST]'
     Lists the current pageful of headers.

`from [MSGLIST]'
`f [MSGLIST]'
     Lists the contents of `From' headers for a given set of messages.

`z [ARG]'
     Presents message headers in pagefuls as described for `headers'
     command.  When ARG is `.', it is generally equivalent to
     `headers'.  When ARG is omitted or is `+', the next pageful of
     headers is displayed.  If ARG is `-', the previous pageful of
     headers is displayed.  The latter two forms of `z' command may
     also take a numerical argument meaning the number of pages to skip
     before displaying the headers.  For example:

          & z +2
     will skip two pages of messages before displaying the header
     summary.

`size [MSGLIST]'
`si [MSGLIST]'
     Lists the message number and message size in bytes for each
     message in MSGLIST.

`folders'
     Displays the value of `folder' variable.

`summary'
`su'
     Displays current mailbox summary.  E.g.:

3.5.4.7 Displaying Messages
...........................

`print [MSGLIST]'
`p [MSGLIST]'

`type [MSGLIST]'
`t [MSGLIST]'
     Prints out the messages from MSGLIST.  The variable `crt'
     determines the minimum number of lines the body of the message must
     contain in order to be piped through pager command specified by
     environment variable `PAGER'.  If `crt' is set to a numeric value,
     this value is taken as the minimum number of lines.  Otherwise, if
     `crt' is set without a value then the height of the terminal
     screen is used to compute the threshold.  The number of lines on
     screen is controlled by `screen' variable.

`Print [MSGLIST]'
`P [MSGLIST]'
`Type [MSGLIST]'
`T [MSGLIST]'
     Like print but also prints out ignored header fields.

`decode [MSGLIST]'
`dec [MSGLIST]'
     Print a multipart message.  The `decode' command decodes and prints
     out specified message parts.  E.g.
          & decode 15[2]
          +---------------------------------------
          | Message=15[2]
          | Type=message/delivery-status
          | encoding=7bit
          +---------------------------------------
          Content-Type: message/delivery-status
          ...

`top [MSGLIST]'
`to [MSGLIST]'
     Prints the top few lines of each message in MSGLIST.  The number
     of lines printed is controlled by the variable `toplines' and
     defaults to five.

`pipe [MSGLIST] [SHELL-COMMAND]'
`| [MSGLIST] [SHELL-COMMAND]'
     Pipe the contents of specified messages through SHELL-COMMAND.  If
     SHELL-COMMAND is empty but the string variable `cmd' is set, the
     value of this variable is used as a command name.

`struct [MSGLIST]'
     Prints the MIME structure of each message from MSGLIST.  Empty
     MSGLIST means current message.

     Example:

          & struct 2
          2      multipart/mixed            14k
          2[1]   text/plain                 296

     current session the deleted messages can be referred to in message
     lists using :d notation.

`undelete [MSGLIST]'
`u [MSGLIST]'
     Clear delete mark from the specified messages.

`dp [MSGLIST]'

3.5.4.10 Saving Messages
........................

`save [[MSGLIST] FILE]'
`s [[MSGLIST] FILE]'
     Takes a message list and a file name and appends each message in
     turn to the end of the file.  The name of file and number of
     characters appended to it is echoed on the terminal.  Each saved
     message is marked for deletion as if with `delete' command, unless
     the variable `keepsave' is set.

`Save [MSGLIST]'
`S [MSGLIST]'
     Like `save', but the file to append messages to is named after the
     sender of the first message in MSGLIST.  For example:

          & from 14 15
           U  14 smith@noldor.org Fri Jun 30 18:11  14/358   The Save c

          & Save 14 15
          "smith" 22/603
     i.e., 22 lines (603 characters) have been appended to the file
     "smith".  If the file does not exist, it is created.

`write [[MSGLIST] FILE]'
`w [[MSGLIST] FILE]'
     Similar to `save', except that only message body (without the
     header) is saved.

`Write [MSGLIST]'
`W [MSGLIST]'
     Similar to `Save', except that only message body (without the
     header) is saved.

`mbox [MSGLIST]'
`mb [MSGLIST]'
`touch [MSGLIST]'
`tou [MSGLIST]'
     Mark list of messages to be saved in the user's mailbox
     (`$HOME/mbox') upon exiting via `quit' command.  This is the
     default action for all read messages, unless you have variable
     `hold' set.

`copy [[MSGLIST] FILE]'
`c [[MSGLIST] FILE]'
     Similar to `save', except that saved messages are not marked for
     deletion.

3.5.4.11 Editing Messages
.........................

These command allow to edit messages in a mailbox.  _Please note_, that
modified messages currently do not replace original ones. i.e.  you
have to save them explicitly using your editor's `save' command if you

.................

`alias [alias [ADDRESS...]]'
`a [alias [ADDRESS...]]'
`group [alias [ADDRESS...]]'
`g [alias [ADDRESS...]]'
     With no arguments, prints out all currently-defined aliases.  With
     one argument, prints out that alias.  With more than one argument,
     creates a new alias or changes an old one.

`unalias [ALIAS...]'
`una [ALIAS...]'
     Takes a list of names defined by alias commands and discards the
     remembered groups of users.  The alias names no longer have any
     significance.

`alternates NAME...'
`alt NAME...'
     The alternates command is useful if you have accounts on several
     machines.  It can be used to inform mail that the listed addresses
     are really you.  When you reply to messages, mail will not send a
     copy of the message to any of the addresses listed on the
     alternates list.  If the alternates command is given with no
     argument, the current set of alternate names is displayed.

3.5.4.13 Replying
.................

`mail [ADDRESS...]'
`m [ADDRESS...]'
     Switches to compose mode.  After composing the message, sends
     messages to the specified addresses.

`reply [MSGLIST]'
`respond [MSGLIST]'
`r [MSGLIST]'
     For each message in MSGLIST, switches to compose mode and sends
     the composed message to the sender and all recipients of the
     message.

`Reply [MSGLIST]'
`Respond [MSGLIST]'
`R [MSGLIST]'
     Like `reply', except that the composed message is sent only to
     originators of the specified messages.

     Notice, that setting mail variable `flipr' (*note Mail
     Variables::) swaps the meanings of the two above commands, so that
     `reply' sends the message to the sender and all recipients of the
     message, whereas `Reply' sends it to originators only.

`followup [MSGLIST]'
`fo [MSGLIST]'
     Switches to compose mode.  After composing, sends the message to
     the originators and recipients of all messages in MSGLIST.

`Followup [MSGLIST]'
`F [MSGLIST]'
     Similar to `followup', but reply message is sent only to
     originators of messages in MSGLIST.

   To determine the sender of the message `mail' uses the list of
sender fields (*note Controlling Sender Fields::).  The first field
from this list is looked up in message headers.  If it is found and
contains a valid email address, this address is used as the sender
address.  If not, the second field is searched and so on.  This process
continues until a field is found in the headers, or the sender field
list is exhausted, whichever happens first.

   If the previous step did not determine the sender address, the
address from SMTP envelope is used.

   Let's illustrate this.  Suppose your mailbox contains the following:

     Hi

Now, you issue the following commands:

     & sender mail-followup-to reply-to from
     & reply
     To: <root@helsingor.org>
     Subject: Re: News

As you see, the value of `Reply-To' field was taken as the sender
address.

   Now, let's try the following command sequence:

     # Clear the sender list
     & nosender
     # Set new sender list
     & sender From

Now, the `From' address will be taken:

3.5.4.14 Controlling Sender Fields
..................................

Commands `sender' and `nosender' are used to manipulate the contents of
the sender field list.

   If the command `sender' is used without arguments, it displays the
contents of the sender field list.  If arguments are given, each
argument is appended to the sender field list.  For example:

     & sender
     Sender address is obtained from the envelope
     & sender mail-followup-to reply-to
     & sender
     mail-followup-to
     reply-to
     & sender from
     & sender
     mail-followup-to
     reply-to
     from

   Command `nosender' is used to remove items from the sender field
list:

     & sender
     mail-followup-to
     reply-to
     from
     & nosender reply-to
     & sender
     mail-followup-to
     from

   When used without arguments, this command clears the list:

     & nosender
     Sender address is obtained from the envelope

3.5.4.16 Shell Escapes
......................

To run arbitrary shell command from `mail' command prompt, use `shell'
(`sh') command.  If no arguments are specified, the command starts the
user login shell.  Otherwise, it uses its first argument as a file name
to execute and all subsequent arguments are passed as positional
parameters to this command.  The `shell' command can also be spelled as
`!'.

3.5.5 Scripting
---------------

Comments
........

The `#' character introduces an end-of-line comment.  All characters
until and including the end of line are ignored.

Displaying Arbitrary Text
.........................

The `echo' (`ec') command prints its arguments to stdout.

Sourcing External Command Files
...............................

The command `source FILENAME' reads commands from the named file.  Its
minimal abbreviation is `so'.

Setting and Unsetting the Variables
...................................

The mail variables are set using `set' (`se') command.  The command
takes a list of assignments.  The syntax of an assignment is

`NAME=STRING'
     Assign a string value to the variable.  If STRING contains
     whitespace characters it must be enclosed in a pair of
     double-quote characters (`"')

`NAME=NUMBER'
     Assign a numeric value to the variable.

`NAME'
     Assign boolean `True' value.

`noNAME'
     Assign boolean `False' value.

   Example:

     & set askcc nocrt indentprefix="> "
   This statement sets `askcc' to `True', `crt' to `False', and
`indentprefix' to "> ".

   To unset mail variables use `unset'(`uns') command.  The command
takes a list of variable names to unset.

   Example: To undo the effect of the previous example, do:

     & unset askcc crt indentprefix

   When used without arguments, both `set' or `unset' list all
currently defined variables.  The form of this listing is controlled by
`variable-pretty-print' (`varpp') variable.  If it is set, a
description precedes each variable, e.g.:

     # prompt user for subject before composing the message
     ask
     # prompt user for cc before composing the message
     askcc
     # output character set for decoded header fields
     charset="auto"
     # number of columns on terminal screen
     columns=80

   If `variable-pretty-print' is not set, only the settings are shown,
e.g.:

     ask
     askcc
     charset="auto"
     columns=80

   A special command is provided to list all internal `mail' variables:

     variable [NAMES...]

   If used without arguments, it prints all known internal variables.
If arguments are given, it displays only those internal variables that
are listed in command line.  For each variable, this command prints its
name, data type, current value and a short description.  For example:

     & variable ask datefield
     ask, asksub
     Type: boolean
     Current value: yes
     prompt user for subject before composing the message

     datefield
     Type: boolean
     Current value: [not set]
     get date from the `Date:' header, instead of the envelope

Setting and Unsetting Shell Environment Variables
.................................................

Shell environment may be modified using `setenv' (`sete') command.  The
command takes a list of assignments.  The syntax of an assignment is:

`NAME=VALUE'
     If variable NAME does not already exist in the environment, then
     it is added to the environment with the value VALUE.  If NAME does
     exist, then its value in the environment is changed to VALUE.

`NAME'
     Delete the variable NAME from the environment ("unset" it).

Conditional Statements
......................

The conditional statement allows to execute a set of mail commands
depending on the mode the `mail' program is in.  The conditional
statement is:

     if COND
     ...
     else
     ...
     endif
   where `...' represents the set of commands to be executed in each
branch of the statement.  COND can be one of the following:

`s'
     True if `mail' is operating in mail sending mode.

`r'
     True if `mail' is operating in mail reading mode.

`t'
     True if stdout is a terminal device (as opposed to a regular file).

   The conditional statements can be nested to arbitrary depth.  The
minimal abbreviations for `if', `else' and `endif' commands are `i',
`el' and `en'.

   Example:

     if t
     set crt prompt="& "
     else
     unset prompt
     endif
     if s
     alt gray@farlep.net gray@mirddin.farlep.net
     set

3.5.6 How to Alter the Behavior of `mail'
-----------------------------------------

Following variables control the behavior of GNU `mail':

`append'
     Type: Boolean, Read-Only
     Default: True 

     Messages saved in mbox are appended to the end rather than
     prepended.  This is the default and cannot be changed.  This
     variable exists only for compatibility with other `mailx'
     implementations.

`appenddeadletter'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     If this variable is `True', the contents of canceled letter is
     appended to the user's `dead.letter' file.  Otherwise it overwrites
     its contents.

`askbcc'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     When set to `True' the user will be prompted to enter `Bcc' field
     before composing the message.

`askcc'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: True.  

     When set to `True' the user will be prompted to enter `Cc' field
     before composing the message.

`asksub'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: True in interactive mode, False otherwise.  

     When set to `True' the user will be prompted to enter `Subject'
     field before composing the message.

`autoinc'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: True.  

     Automatically incorporate newly arrived messages.

`autoprint'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     Causes the delete command to behave like dp - thus, after deleting
     a message, the next one will be typed automatically.

`bang'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     When set, every occurrence of `!' in arguments to `!' command is
     replaced with the last executed command.

`byname'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: Unset 

     Record outgoing messages in a file named after the first recipient.
     The name is the login-name portion of the address found first on
     the `To:' line in the mail header.  This variable overrides the
     `record' variable.

     It is set by the `--byname' (`-F') command line option.

`datefield'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     By default the date in a header summary is taken from the SMTP
     envelope of the message.  Setting this variable tells `mail' to
     use the date from `Date:' header field, converted to local time.
     Notice, that for messages lacking this field `mail' will fall back
     to using SMTP envelope.

     *Note fromfield::.

`charset'
     Type: string
     Default: `auto' 

     The value of this variable controls the output character set for
     the header fields encoding using RFC 2047.  If the variable is
     unset, no decoding is performed and the fields are printed as they
     are.  If the variable is set to `auto', `mail' tries to deduce the
     name of the character set from the value of `LC_ALL' environment
     variable.  Otherwise, its value is taken as the name of the
     charset.

`cmd'
     Type: String.
     Default: Unset.  

     Contains default shell command for `pipe'.

`columns'
     Type: Numeric.
     Default: Detected at startup by querying the terminal device.  If
     this fails, the value of environment variable `COLUMNS' is used.  

     This variable contains the number of columns on terminal screen.

`crt'
     Type: Boolean or Numeric
     Default: True in interactive mode, False otherwise.  

     The variable `crt' determines the minimum number of lines the body
     of the message must contain in order to be piped through pager
     command specified by environment variable `PAGER'.  If `crt' is set
     to a numeric value, this value is taken as the threshold.
     Otherwise, if `crt' is set without a value, then the height of the
     terminal screen is used to compute the threshold.  The number of
     lines on screen is controlled by `screen' variable.

`debug'
     Type: String to boolean
     Default: Not set 

     Sets mailutils debug level.  If set to string, the value must be a
     valid Mailutils debugging specification.  *Note Debug Statement::,
     for a description.

     If unset (i.e.  `set nodebug'), clears and disables all debugging
     information.  If set to `true' (i.e.  `set debug'), sets maximum
     debugging (`<trace7') on mailbox and its underlying objects.

`decode-fallback'
     Type: String.
     Default: `none'.  

     This variable controls the way to represent characters that cannot
     be rendered using current character set.  It can have three values:

    `none'
          Such characters are not printed at all.  The conversion
          process stops at the first character that cannot be rendered.

    `copy-pass'
          The characters are displayed `as is'.  Notice, that depending
          on your setup, this may screw-up your terminal settings.

    `copy-octal'
          Unprintable characters are represented by their octal codes.
          Printable ones are printed `as is'.

`debug'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: Unset 

     This variable is not used.  It exists for compatibility with other
     `mailx' implementations and for future use.

`dot'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     If `True', causes `mail' to interpret a period alone on a line as
     the terminator of a message you are sending.

`emptystart'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     If the mailbox is empty, `mail' normally prints `No mail for user'
     and exits immediately.  If this option is set, `mail' will start
     no matter is the mailbox empty or not.

`editheaders'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     When set, `mail' will include message headers in the text to be
     the `~e' and `~v' escapes, thus allowing you to customize the
     headers.

`escape'
     Type: String.
     Default: ~ 

     If defined, the first character of this option gives the character
     to denoting escapes.

`flipr'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: Unset 

     If set, the variable `flipr' swaps the meanings of `reply' and
     `Reply' commands (*note Replying::).

`folder'
     Type: String.
     Default: Unset.  

     The name of the directory to use for storing folders of messages.
     If unset, `$HOME' is assumed.

`fromfield'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: True.

     By default the sender address is taken from the `From' header.
     Unsetting this variable tells `mail' to obtain it from the SMTP
     envelope, instead.

     *Note datefield::.

`header'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: True, unless started with `--nosum' (`-N') option.  

     Whether to run `headers' command automatically after entering
     interactive mode.

`headline'
     Type: String
     Default: `%>%a%4m %18f %16d %3l/%-5o %s'

     A format string to use for the header summary.  The `%' character
     introduces a "format specifier".  Valid format specifiers are:

     Letter        Meaning
     --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     %a            Message attributes.
     %d            The date when the message was received.
     %f            The address of the message sender.
     %l            The number of lines of the message.
     %m            Message number.
     %o            The number of octets (bytes) in the message.
     %s            Message subject (if any).
     %S            Message subject (if any) in double quotes.
     %>            A `>' for the current message, otherwise a space.
     %<            A `<' for the current message, otherwise a space.
     %%            A `%' character.

     Some additional symbols are allowed between `%' and the specifier
     letter.  The `-' character immediately following `%' indicates
     that this field should be left aligned.  Similarly, the `+'
     character indicates right alignment.  Default alignment depends on
     the type of the specifier: the specifiers that produce numeric
     values (`%l', `%m', and `%o') are aligned to the right, whereas
     the ones producing string values are aligned to the left.

     A number following `%' or the alignment flag, indicates the field
     width.  Consider, for example, the following specifiers:

    %m
          Print current message number.  Take as much screen columns as
          necessary to output it.

    %4m
    %+4m
          Print current message number.  Occupy 4 screen columns,
          truncate the output if it does not fit that width.  Align the
          output to the right.

    %-4m
          Same as above, but align to the left.

`hold'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     When set to `True', the read or saved messages will be stored in
     user's mailbox (`$HOME/mbox').  Otherwise, they will be held in
     system mailbox also.  This option is in effect only when operating
     upon user's system mailbox.

`ignore'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     When set to `True', `mail' will ignore keyboard interrupts when
     composing messages.  Otherwise an interrupt will be taken as a
     signal to abort composing.

`ignoreeof'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     Controls whether typing EOF character terminates the letter being
     composed.

`indentprefix'
     Type: String.
     Default: "\t" (a tab character).  

     String used by the `~m' tilde escape for indenting quoted messages.

`inplacealiases'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: False

     If set, `mail' will expand aliases in the address header field
     before entering send mode (*note Composing Mail::).  By default,
     the address header fields are left intact while composing, the
     alias expansion takes place immediately before sending message.

`keep'
     Type: Boolean, Read-Only
     Default: True 

     Truncate the user's system mailbox when it is empty, instead of
     removing it.  This is the default and cannot be changed.  This
     variable exists only for compatibility with other `mailx'
     implementations.

`keepsave'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     Controls whether saved messages should be kept in system mailbox
     too.  This variable is in effect only when operating upon a user's
     system mailbox.

`mailx'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     When set, enables "mailx compatibility mode".  This mode has the
     following effects:

        * When composing a message `mail' will ask for `Cc' and `Bcc'
          addresses after composing the body.  The default behavior is
          to ask for these values before composing the body.

        * In send mode, if the composition was interrupted, `mail' will
          exit with zero status.  By default it exits with zero status
          only if the message was sent successfully.

`metamail'
     Type: Boolean or String.
     Default: True.  

     This variable controls operation of `decode' command.  If it is
     unset, `decode' will not attempt any interpretation of the content
     of message parts.  Otherwise, if `metamail' is set to `true',
     `decode' will use internal metamail support to interpret message
     parts.  Finally, if `metamail' is assigned a string, this string
     is treated as command line of the external `metamail' command
     which will be used to display parts of a multipart message.  For
     example:

          # Disable MIME interpretation:
          set nometamail
          # Enable built-in MIME support:
          set metamail
          # Use external program to display MIME parts:
          set metamail="metamail -m mail -p"

`mimenoask'
     Type: String
     Default: Empty 

     By default `mail' asks for confirmation before running interpreter
     to view a part of the multi-part message.  If this variable is
     set, its value is treated as a comma-separated list of MIME types
     for which no confirmation is needed.  Elements of this list may
     include shell-style globbing patterns, e.g. setting

          set mimenoask=text/*,image/jpeg

     will disable prompting before displaying any textual files, no
     matter what their subtype is, and before displaying files with
     type `image/jpeg'.

`metoo'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     Usually, when an alias is expanded that contains the sender, the
     sender is removed from the expansion.  Setting this option causes
     the sender to be included in the group.

`mode'
     Type: String, Read-Only
     Default: The name of current operation mode.  

     This variable keeps the name of the current operation mode.  Its
     possible values are:

    headers
          The program is started with the `--headers' (`-H') command
          line option (*note Invoking Mail::).

    exist
          The program is started with the `--exist' (`-e') command line
          option (*note Invoking Mail::).

    print
          The program is started with the `--print' (`-p') command line
          option (*note Invoking Mail::).

    read
          The progran operates in read mode.  This is the default.

    send
          The program operates in send mode.  This means it was given
          one or more recipient addresses in the command line.

`nullbody'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: True 

     Controls whether `mail' accepts messages with an empty body.  The
     default value, `true', means such messages are sent, and a warning
     (traditionally saying `Null message body; hope that's ok') is
     displayed.  The text of the warning can be set using `nullbodymsg'
     variable (see below).

     If `nullbody' is unset, `mail' will silently ignore such messages.
     This can be useful in `crontab' files, to avoid sending mails when
     nothing important happens.  For example, the `crontab' entry below
     will send mail only if the utility `some-prog' outputs something
     on its standard output or error:

             /bin/mail -E'set nonullbody' -s 'Periodic synchronization'

`showenvelope'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: Unset

     If this variable is set, the `print' command will include the STMP
     envelope in its output.

`nullbodymsg'
     Type: String
     Default: Null message body; hope that's ok 

     Keeps the text of the warning, displayed by `mail' before sending
     an empty message.  When available, the translation of this text,
     in accordance with the current locale, is displayed.

     Unsetting this variable disables the warning.

`onehop'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: Unset 

     This variable is not used.  It exists for compatibility with other
     `mailx' implementations and for future use.

`outfolder'
     Type: String.
     Default: Unset.  

     Contains the directory in which files created by `save', `write',
     etc. commands will be stored.  When unset, current directory is
     assumed.

`page'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.  

     If set to `True', the `pipe' command will emit a linefeed
     character after printing each message.

`prompt'
     Type: String.
     Default: "? " 

     Contains the command prompt sequence.

`quiet'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: Unset 

     This variable is not used.  It exists for compatibility with other
     `mailx' implementations and for future use.

`quit'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False, unless started with `--quit' (`-q') option.  

     When set, causes keyboard interrupts to terminate the program.

`rc'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: True, unless started with `--norc' (`-N') option.  

     When this variable is set, `mail' will read the system-wide
     configuration file upon startup.  See *note Mail Configuration
     Files::.

`readonly'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: False 

     When set, mailboxes are opened in readonly mode.  In this mode, any
     `mail' commands that alter the contents of the mailbox are
     disabled.  These commands include, but are not limited to:
     `delete', `save' and `mbox'.

`record'
     Type: String.
     Default: Unset.  

     When set, any outgoing message will be saved to the named file.

`recursivealiases'
     Type: Boolean
     Default: True

     When set, `mail' will expand aliases recursively.

`regex'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: True.  

     Setting this to `True' enables use of regular expressions in
     `/.../' message specifications.

`replyprefix'
     Type: String
     Default: `Re: ' 

     Sets the prefix that will be used when constructing the subject
     line of a reply message.

     Default: `^re: *' 

     Sets the regular expression used to recognize subjects of reply
     messages.  If the `Subject' header of the message matches this
     expression, the value of `replyprefix' will not be prepended to it
     before replying.  The expression should be a POSIX extended regular
     expression.  The comparison is case-insensitive.

     For example, to recognize usual English, Polish, Norwegian and
     German reply subject styles, use:

          set replyregex="^(re|odp|aw|ang)(\\[[0-9]+\\])?:[[:blank:]]"

     (Notice the quoting of backslash characters).

`return-address'
     Type: String

     the header summary.

`Sign'
     Type: String.
     Default: Unset.  

     Contains the filename holding users signature.  The contents of
     this file is appended to the end of a message being composed by
     `~A' escape.

`sign'
     Type: String.
     Default: Unset.  

     Contains the user's signature.  The contents of this variable is
     appended to the end of a message being composed by `~a' escape.
     Use `Sign' variable, if your signature occupies more than one line.

     Number of lines to be displayed by `top' and `Top' commands.

`variable-strict'
`varstrict'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.

     Setting this variable enables strict control over variable
     settings.  In this mode, `mail' refuses to set read-only
     variables.  Also, if the user is trying to set an unknown variable,
     `mail' prints a warning.

     *Note Setting and Unsetting the Variables::.

`variable-pretty-print'
`varpp'
     Type: Boolean.
     Default: False.

          X-Mailer: mail (GNU Mailutils 2.99.98)



File: mailutils.info,  Node: Mail Configuration Files,  Prev: Mail Variables,  Up: mail

3.5.7 Personal and System-wide Configuration Files
--------------------------------------------------

Upon startup, `mail' reads the contents of the two command files: the
system-wide configuration file, and the user's configuration file.
Each line read from these files is processed like a usual `mail'
command.

   When run with `--norc' (`-N') option, `mail' does not read the
contents of system-wide configuration file.  The user's file, if it
exists, is always processed.

   The user's configuration file is located in the user's home
directory and is named `.mailrc'.  The location and name of the
system-wide configuration file is determined when configuring the
package via `--with-mail-rc' option.  It defaults to
`SYSCONFDIR/mail.rc'.

3.6 `messages' -- Count the Number of Messages in a Mailbox
===========================================================

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

`Messages' prints on standard output the number of messages contained
in each folder specified in command line.  If no folders are specified,
it operates upon user's system mailbox.  For each folder, the following
output line is produced:

     Number of messages in FOLDER: NUMBER

where FOLDER represents the folder name, NUMBER represents the number
of messages.

   Following configuration file statements affect the behaviour of
`messages':

3.7 `movemail' -- Moves Mail from the User Maildrop to the Local File
=====================================================================

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

The purpose of `movemail', as its name implies, is to move mail from
one location to another.  For example, the following invocation:

     movemail /var/mail/smith INBOX

moves messages from file `/var/mail/smith' to file `INBOX'.

   You will probably never have to run this program manually.  It is
intended as a replacement for `movemail' from GNU Emacs.  The
`movemail' program is run by Emacs `Rmail' module.  *Note Rmail:
(emacs)Rmail, for detailed description of `Rmail' interface.

   Mailutils version of `movemail' is fully backward-compatible with
its Emacs predecessor, so it should run flawlessly with older versions
of Emacs.  Emacs versions starting from 22.1 contain improved `Rmail'
interface and are able to take advantage of all new features mailutils
`movemail' provides.

3.7.1 Movemail Configuration
----------------------------

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

Following configuration file statements affect the behavior of
`movemail':

 -- Movemail Config: preserve BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', do not remove messages from the source mailbox.

 -- Movemail Config: reverse BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', reverse message sorting order.

 -- Movemail Config: emacs BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', output information used by Emacs rmail
     interface.

 -- Movemail Config: ignore-erros BOOL
     Continue moving messages after errors.  By default, `mailfromd'
     exits immediately if it cannot copy a message.

 -- Movemail Config: program-id FMT
     Set program identifier, i.e. a string which will prefix all
     diagnostic messages issued by the program.  By default, program
     name is used.

     The FMT is a format string that may contain references to the
     following macro variables (see macro-variables (*Editor's note:
     dangling link*) ):

    `progname'
          The program name.

    `source'
          URL of the source mailbox.

    `source:user'
          User part of the source mailbox URL.

    `source:host'
          Host part of the source mailbox URL.

    `source:path'
          Path part of the source mailbox URL.

    `dest'
          URL of the destination mailbox

    `dest:user'
          User part of the destination mailbox URL.

    `dest:host'
          Host part of the destination mailbox URL.

    `dest:path'
          Path part of the destination mailbox URL.

     Setting `program-id' may be necessary if several `movemail'
     instances are run simultaneously (e.g. invoked from a script) to
     discern between the instances.  For example:

          program-id "${progname}: ${source} => ${dest}"

 -- Movemail Config: uidl BOOL
     Avoid copying the message if a message with the same UIDL already
     exists in the destination mailbox.

 -- Movemail Config: verbose LEVEL
     Set verbosity level.

 -- Movemail Config: mailbox-ownership METHOD-LIST
     Define list of methods for setting ownership of the destination
     mailbox.  The METHOD-LIST argument can contain the following
     elements:

    copy-id
          Copy owner UID and GID from the source mailbox.  This method
          works only with local mailboxes, i.e.: `mbox' (UNIX mailbox),
          `maildir' and `mh'.

    copy-name
          Get owner name from the source mailbox URL and obtain UID and
          GID for this user using mailutils authorization methods.

    set-id=UID[:GID]
          Set supplied UID and GID.  If GID is not supplied, it is read
          from the `/etc/passwd' record for this UID.

    set-name=USER
          Make destination mailbox owned by USER.

This subsection discusses `movemail' options from the point of view of
an Emacs `Rmail' user.

   To set various options to `movemail' from `Rmail', use
`rmail-movemail-flags' variable, or `Rmail Movemail Flags' section from
the menu.

   Some POP servers return messages in reversed order.  To fix the
order, use `-p' option or its synonym `--reverse'.

   If the remote server supports TLS encryption, use `--tls' to
instruct `movemail' to initiate encrypted connection.

3.7.4 Movemail Usage Summary
----------------------------

     movemail [OPTION...] INBOX DESTFILE [REMOTE-PASSWORD]

   The first argument, INBOX, is the url (see URL (*Editor's note:
dangling link*) ) of the source mailbox.  The second argument,
DESTFILE, traditionally means destination file, i.e. the UNIX mailbox
to copy messages to.  However, mailutils `movemail' extends the meaning
of this parameter.  You may actually specify any valid URL as DESTFILE
parameter.(1).  Finally, optional third argument is a traditional way of
specifying user passwords for remote (POP or IMAP) mailboxes.

   Following is the summary of available command line options:

`--emacs'
     Output information used by Emacs rmail interface

`--ignore-errors'
     Continue moving messages after an error occurs.

`-p'
`--preserve'
`--keep-messages'
     Preserve the source mailbox

`--program-id=FMT'
     Set program identifier for diagnostic purposes.  See *note
     program-id: Movemail Configuration, for a detailed discussion of
     this feature.

`-r'
`--reverse'
     Reverse the sorting order

`--tls[=BOOL]'
     Enable (default) or disable TLS support

`-u'

`--uidl'
     Use UIDLs to avoid downloading the same message twice.

`-P METHOD-LIST'
`--owner=METHOD-LIST'
     Define list of methods for setting ownership of the destination
     mailbox.  *Note mailbox-ownership-methods::, for a description of
     METHOD-LIST.  This option is useful only when running `movemail'
     as root.

`-v'

`--verbose'
     Increase verbosity level.

3.8 `readmsg' -- Extract Messages from a Folder
===============================================

The `readmsg' utility extracts messages from a mailbox according to the
criteria specified in the command line.  These criteria are:

  1. A lone `*' means "select all messages in the mailbox".

  2. A list of message numbers may be specified.  Values of  `0'  and
     `$' in the list both mean the last message in the mailbox.  For
     example:
          readmsg 1 3 0
     extracts three messages from the folder: the first, the third, and
     the last.

  3. Finally, the selection may be some text to match.  This will
     select a mail message which exactly matches the specified text.
     For example,
          readmsg staff meeting
     extracts the message which contains the words `staff meeting'.
     Note that it will not match a message containing `Staff Meeting' -
     the matching is case sensitive.  Normally only the first message
     which matches the pattern is printed.

     If BOOL is `true', display entire headers.

 -- Readmsg Conf: weedlist STR
     Set the weedlist.  The STR argument is a string, containing a list
     of header names, separated by whitespace, commands or colons.
     This corresponds to the `--weedlist' command line option (*note
     -weedlist: Opt-readmsg.).

 -- Readmsg Conf: no-header BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', exclude all headers.

 -- Readmsg Conf: form-feeds BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', output formfeed character between messages.

 -- Readmsg Conf: folder URL

3.9 `sieve'
===========

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

Sieve is a language for filtering e-mail messages at time of final
delivery, described in RFC 3028.  GNU Mailutils provides two
implementations of this language: a stand-alone "sieve interpreter" and
a "sieve translator and filter".  The following sections describe these
utilities in detail.

3.9.1 A Sieve Interpreter
-------------------------

Sieve interpreter `sieve' allows to apply Sieve scripts to an arbitrary
number of mailboxes.  GNU `sieve' implements a superset of the Sieve
language as described in RFC 3028.  *Note Sieve Language::, for a
description of the Sieve language.  *Note GNU Extensions::, for a
discussion of differences between the GNU implementation of Sieve and
its standard.

The `sieve' invocation syntax is:

     sieve [OPTIONS] SCRIPT

where SCRIPT denotes the filename of the sieve program to parse, and
OPTIONS is one or more of the following:

`-c'
`--compile-only'
     Compile script and exit.

`--clear-library-path'
`--clearpath'
     Clear Sieve library path.  See also *note clear-library-path:
     Sieve Configuration.

`--clear-include-path'
     Clear Sieve include path.  See also *note clear-include-path:
     Sieve Configuration.

`-d[FLAGS]'
`--debug[=FLAGS]'
     Specify debug flags.  The FLAGS argument is a sequence of one or
     more of the following letters:

     `g'                         Enable main parser traces
     `T'                         Enable mailutils traces

     Used within the `sieve' block statement.

     If BOOL is `true', clear library search path.

 -- Sieve Conf: clear-include-path BOOL
     Used within the `sieve' block statement.

     If BOOL is `true', clear include search path.

 -- Sieve Conf: library-path PATH
     Used within the `sieve' block statement.

     Add directories to `sieve' library search path.  Argument is a
     string containing a colon-separated list of directories.

 -- Sieve Conf: include-path PATH
     Used within the `sieve' block statement.

     Add directories to the include search path.  Argument is a string
     containing a colon-separated list of directories.

 -- Sieve Conf: keep-going BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', do not abort if execution of a Sieve script
     fails on a particular message.

 -- Sieve Conf: mbox-url URL
     Sets URL of the mailbox to be processed.

 -- Sieve Conf: ticket FILE
     Sets the name of the ticket file for user authentication.

 -- Sieve Conf: debug FLAGS
     Sets Sieve debug flags.  *Note Logging and Debugging::, for a
     detailed description.

 -- Sieve Conf: verbose BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', log all executed actions.

 -- Sieve Conf: line-info BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', print source locations along with action logs.
     This statement takes effect only if `verbose true' is also set.

 -- Sieve Conf: email ADDR
     Set user e-mail address.  This is useful for `reject' and
     `redirect' actions.  By default, the user email address is deduced
     from the user name and the full name of the machine where `sieve'
     is executed.

3.9.1.3 Logging and debugging
.............................

The default behavior of `sieve' is to remain silent about anything
except errors.  However, it is sometimes necessary to see which actions
are executed and on which messages.  This is particularly useful when
debugging the sieve scripts.  The `--verbose' (`-v') option outputs log
of every action executed.

   Option `--debug' allows to produce even more detailed debugging
information.  This option takes an argument specifying the debugging
level to be enabled.  The argument can consist of the following letters:

``t''
     This flag enables sieve tracing.  It means that every test will be
     logged when executed.

``T''
     This flag enables debugging of underlying `mailutils' library.

``P''
     Trace network protocols: produces log of network transactions
     executed while running the script.

``g''
     Enable main parser traces.  This is useful for debugging the sieve
     grammar.

``i''
     Trace the program instructions.  It is the most extensive debugging
     level.  It produces the full execution log of a sieve program,
     showing each instruction and states of the sieve machine.  It is
     only useful for debugging the code generator.

   _Note_, that there should be no whitespace between the short variant
of the option (`-d'), and its argument.  Similarly, when using long
option (`--debug'), its argument must be preceded by equal sign.

   If the argument to `--debug' is omitted, it defaults to `TPt'.

   Option `--dump' produces the disassembled dump of the compiled sieve
program.

   By default `sieve' output all diagnostics on standard error and
verbose logs on standard output.  This behaviour is changed when
`--log-facility' is given in the command line (see logging (*Editor's
note: dangling link*) ).  This option causes `sieve' to output its
diagnostics to the given syslog facility.

3.9.1.4 Extending `sieve'
.........................

The basic set of sieve actions, tests and comparators may be extended
using loadable extensions.  Usual `require' mechanism is used for that.

   When processing arguments for `require' statement, `sieve' uses the
following algorithm:

  1. Look up the name in a symbol table.  If the name begins with
     `comparator-' it is looked up in the comparator table.  If it
     begins with `test-', the test table is used instead.  Otherwise
     the name is looked up in the action table.

  2. If the name is found, the search is terminated.

  3. Otherwise, transform the name.  First, any `comparator-' or
     `test-' prefix is stripped.  Then, any character other than
     alphanumeric characters, `.' and `,' is replaced with dash (`-').
     The name thus obtained is used as a file name of an external
     loadable module.

  4. Try to load the module.  The module is searched in the following
     search paths (in the order given):

       1. Mailutils module directory.  By default it is
          `$prefix/lib/mailutils'.

       2. The value of the environment variable `LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH'.

       3. Additional search directories specified with the
          `library-path' statement (*note library-path: Sieve
          Configuration.) in Sieve configuration file.

       4. Additional search directories specified with the.  `--libdir'
          command line option (see libdir (*Editor's note: dangling
          link*) ).

       5. Additional search directories specified with the
          `#searchpath' Sieve directive (*note #searchpath::).

       6. System library search path: The system dependent library
          search path (e.g. on Linux it is set by the contents of the
          file `/etc/ld.so.conf' and the value of the environment
          variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH').

     The value of `LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH' and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' must be a
     colon-separated list of absolute directories, for example,
     `"/usr/lib/mypkg:/lib/foo"'.

     In any of these directories, `sieve' first attempts to find and
     load the given filename.  If this fails, it tries to append the
     following suffixes to the file name:

       1. the libtool archive extension `.la'

       2. the extension used for native dynamic libraries on the host
          platform, e.g., `.so', `.sl', etc.

  5. If the module is found, `sieve' executes its initialization
     function (see below) and again looks up the name in the symbol
     table.  If found, search terminates successfully.

  6. If either the module is not found, or the symbol wasn't found
     after execution of the module initialization function, search is
     terminated with an error status.  `sieve' then displays the
     following diagnostic message:

          source for the required action NAME is not available

3.10 `guimb' -- A Mailbox Scanning and Processing Language
==========================================================

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

`Guimb' is for mailboxes what `awk' is for text files.  It processes
mailboxes, applying the user-supplied scheme procedures to each of them
in turn and saves the resulting output in mailbox format.

   The following configuration statements affect the behavior of
`guimb':

File: mailutils.info,  Node: Specifying Scheme Program to Execute,  Next: Specifying Mailboxes to Operate Upon,  Up: guimb

Specifying Scheme Program to Execute
------------------------------------

The Scheme program or expression to be executed is passed to `guimb'
via the following options:

`-s FILE'
`--source FILE'
     Load Scheme source code from FILE.

`-c EXPR'
`--code EXPR'
     Execute given scheme expression.

   The above switches stop further argument processing, and pass all
remaining arguments as the value of `(command-line)'.

   If the remaining arguments must be processed by `guimb' itself, use
following options:

`-e EXPR'
`--expression EXPR'
     Execute scheme expression.

`-f FILE'
`--file FILE'
     Load Scheme source code from FILE.

   You can specify both of them.  In this case, the FILE is read first,
then EXPR is executed.  You may still pass any additional arguments to
the script using `--guile-arg' option.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Specifying Mailboxes to Operate Upon,  Next: Passing Options to Scheme,  Prev: Specifying Scheme Program to Execute,  Up: guimb

Specifying Mailboxes to Operate Upon
------------------------------------

There are four basic ways of passing mailboxes to `guimb'.

`guimb [OPTIONS] [MAILBOX...]'
     The resulting mailbox is not saved, unless the user-supplied
     scheme program saves it.

`guimb [OPTIONS] --mailbox DEFMBOX'
     The contents of DEFMBOX is processed and is replaced with the
     resulting mailbox contents.  Useful for applying filters to user's
     mailbox.

`guimb [OPTIONS] --mailbox DEFMBOX MAILBOX [MAILBOX...]'
     The contents of specified mailboxes is processed, and the resulting
     mailbox contents is appended to DEFMBOX.

`guimb [OPTIONS] --user USERNAME [MAILBOX...]'
     The contents of specified mailboxes is processed, and the resulting
     mailbox contents is appended to the user's system mailbox.  This
     allows to use `guimb' as a mail delivery agent.

   If no mailboxes are specified in the command line, `guimb' reads and
processes the system mailbox of the current user.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Passing Options to Scheme,  Next: Command Line Option Summary,  Prev: Specifying Mailboxes to Operate Upon,  Up: guimb

Passing Options to Scheme
-------------------------

Sometimes it is necessary to pass some command line options to the
scheme procedure.  There are three ways of doing so.

   When using `--source' (`-s') or `--code' (`-c') options, all the
rest of the command line following the option's argument is passed to
Scheme program verbatim.  This allows for making guimb scripts
executable by the shell.  If your system supports `#!' magic at the
start of scripts, add the following two lines to the beginning of your
script to allow for its immediate execution:

     #! /usr/local/bin/guimb -s
     !#

(replace `/usr/local/bin/' with the actual path to the `guimb').

   Otherwise, if you use `--file' or `--expression' options, the
additional arguments may be passed to the Scheme program `-g'
(`--guile-arg') command line option.  For example:

     guimb --guile-arg -opt --guile-arg 24 --file PROGFILE

   In this example, the scheme procedure will see the following command
line:

     PROGFILE -opt 24

   Finally, if there are many arguments to be passed to Scheme, it is
more convenient to enclose them in `-{' and `-}' escapes:

     guimb -{ -opt 24 -} --file PROGFILE

Command Line Option Summary
---------------------------

This is a short summary of the command line options available to
`guimb'.

`-d'
`--debug'
     Start with debugging evaluator and backtraces.

`-e EXPR'
`--expression EXPR'
     Execute given Scheme expression.

`-m PATH'
`--mail-spool=PATH'
     Set path to the mailspool directory

`-f PROGFILE'
`--file PROGFILE'
     Read Scheme program from PROGFILE.

`-g ARG'
`--guile-command ARG'
     Append ARG to the command line passed to Scheme program.

`-{ ... -}'
     Pass all command line options enclosed between `-{' and `-}' to
     Scheme program.

`-m'
`--mailbox MBOX'
     Set default mailbox name.

`-u'
`--user NAME'
     Act as local MDA for user NAME.

`-h'

3.11 maidag
===========

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

The name `maidag' stands for Mail delivery agent.  It is a
general-purpose MDA offering a rich set of features.  It can operate
both in traditional mode, reading the message from its standard input,
and in LMTP mode.  `Maidag' is able to deliver mail to any mailbox
format, supported by GNU Mailutils.  These formats, among others,
include `remote+smtp', `remote+prog' and `remote+sendmail' which are
equivalent to forwarding a message over SMTP to a remote node.  Thus,
`maidag' supersedes both `mail.local' and `mail.remote' utilities from
GNU Mailutils versions prior to 2.0.

   `Maidag' is also able to process incoming messages using Sieve,
Scheme or Python scripts and, based on results of this processing, to
take a decision on whether to actually deliver and where to deliver
them.  Due to its extensive scripting facilities, `maidag' offers much
more flexibility than other popular MDAs, such as `procmail'.

3.11.1 Using `maidag' with Sendmail.
------------------------------------

When used as a MDA with Sendmail, `maidag' must be invoked from the
local mailer definition in the `sendmail.cf' file.  It must have the
following flags set: `lswS'.  These mean: the mailer is local, quote
characters should be stripped off the address before invoking the
mailer, the user must have a valid account on this machine and the
userid should not be reset before calling the mailer.  Additionally,
the flags `fn' may be specified to allow `maidag' to generate the usual
`From ' envelope instead of the one supplied by `sendmail'.

   If you wish to use `maidag' with non-local authentication, such as
SQL or LDAP, you also need to remove the `w' flag, since in that case
the user is not required to have a valid account on the machine that
runs `sendmail'.

   Here is an example of mailer definition in `sendmail.cf'

     Mlocal, P=/usr/local/sbin/maidag,
             F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qSPfhn9,
             S=EnvFromL/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
             T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
             A=mail $u

   To define local mailer in `mc' source file, it will suffice to set:

     define(`LOCAL_MAILER_PATH', `/usr/local/sbin/maidag')
     define(`LOCAL_MAILER_ARGS', `mail $u')

3.11.2 Using `maidag' with Exim.
--------------------------------

Using `maidag' with Exim is quite straightforward.  The following
example illustrates the definition of the appropriate transport and
director in `exim.conf':

     # transport
     maidag_pipe:
       driver = pipe
       command = /usr/local/sbin/maidag $local_part
       return_path_add
       delivery_date_add
       envelope_to_add

     # director
     maidag:
       driver = localuser
       transport = maidag_pipe

3.11.3 Using `maidag' with MeTA1.
---------------------------------

MeTA1 (`http://meta1.org') communicates with the delivery agent using
LMTP.

   LMTP mode is enabled in `maidag' by the `lmpt yes' statement.  The
socket to listen on must be specified using `server' statement (*note
Server Settings::).  For the purposes of this section, let's suppose
`maidag' will listen on a UNIX socket `/var/spool/meta1/lmtpsock'.
Then, the following (minimal) `maidag' configuration will do the job:

     # Start in LMTP mode.
     lmtp yes;
     # Run as daemon.
     mode daemon;
     # Switch to this group after startup.
     group meta1c;
     # Configure server:
     server unix:///var/spool/meta1/lmtpsock {
       transcript no;
     };

   To configure MeTA1 to use this socket, add the following statement to
the `smtpc' section in `/etc/meta1/meta1.conf':

       LMTP_socket="lmtpsock";


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Mailbox Quotas,  Next: Maidag Scripting,  Prev: MeTA1-maidag,  Up: maidag

3.11.4 Mailbox Quotas
---------------------

"Mailbox quota" is a limit on the size of the mailbox.  When a mailbox
size reaches this limit, `maidag' stops accepting messages for this
recipient and returns an error condition to the sender.  The error code
is accompanied by the following error message:

     USER: mailbox quota exceeded for this recipient

   Furthermore, if accepting the incoming message would make the
mailbox size exceed the quota, such a message will be rejected as well.
In this case, the error message is:

     USER: message would exceed maximum mailbox size for this recipient

   In both cases, the default return code will be `service unavailable'
(corresponding to the SMTP return code `550'), unless the following
statement is present in the `maidag' configuration file:

     exit-quota-tempfail yes;

in which case a temporary error will be returned.

   The mailbox quota can be retrieved from the following sources:

  1. Authentication method.

  2. DBM file.

  3. SQL database.

* Menu:

* DBM Quotas::          Keeping Quotas in DBM File.
* SQL Quotas::          Keeping Quotas in SQL Database.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: DBM Quotas,  Next: SQL Quotas,  Up: Mailbox Quotas

3.11.4.1 Keeping Quotas in DBM File
...................................

To use DBM quota database, GNU Mailutils must be compiled with one of
the following command line options: `--with-gdbm',
`--with-berkeley-db', `--with-ndbm', `--with-tokyocabinet', or
`--with-kyotocabinet'.  Examine the output of `maidag
--show-config-options', if not sure.

   The quota database should have the following structure:

Key
     Key represents the user name.  Special key `DEFAULT' means default
     quota value, i.e. the one to be used if the user is not explicitly
     listed in the database.

Value
     Mailbox quota for this user.  If it is a number, it represents the
     maximum mailbox size in bytes.  A number may optionally be
     followed by `kb' or `mb', meaning kilobytes and megabytes,
     respectively.

     A special value `NONE' means no mailbox size limit for this user.

   Here is an example of a valid quota database

     # Default quota value:
     DEFAULT         5mb

     # Following users have unlimited mailbox size
     root            NONE
     smith           NONE

     # Rest of users
     plog            26214400
     karin           10mB

   To use the DBM quota database, specify its absolute name using
`quota-db' configuration statement, e.g.:

     quota-db /etc/mail/quota.db;


File: mailutils.info,  Node: SQL Quotas,  Prev: DBM Quotas,  Up: Mailbox Quotas

3.11.4.2 Keeping Quotas in SQL Database
.......................................

Configuration statement `quota-query' allows to specify a special query
to retrieve the quota from the database.  Currently (as of mailutils
version 2.99.98) it is assumed that this table can be accessed using
the credentials set in `sql' configuration statement (*note SQL
Statement::).

   For example, suppose you have the following quota table:

     create table mailbox_quota (
       user_name varchar(32) binary not null,
       quota int,
       unique (user_name)
     );

To retrieve user quota the following query can be used:

     SELECT quota FROM mailbox_quota WHERE user_name='${user}'

   There are no special provisions for specifying group quotas, similar
to `DEFAULT' in DBM databases.  This is because group quotas can easily
be implemented using SQL language.  `Maidag' always uses the first
tuple from the set returned by mailbox quota query.  So, you may add a
special entry to the `mailbox_quota' table that would keep the group
quota.  In the discussion below we assume that the `user_name' column
for this entry is lexicographically less than any other user name in
the table.  Let's suppose the group quota name is `00DEFAULT'.  Then
the following query:

     SELECT quota
     FROM mailbox_quota
     WHERE user_name IN ('${user}','00DEFAULT')
     ORDER BY user_name DESC

will return two tuples if the user is found in `mailbox_quota'.  Due to
`ORDER' statement, the first tuple will contain the quota for the user,
which will be used by `maidag'.  On the other hand, if the requested
user name is not present in the table, the above query will return a
single tuple containing the group quota.

   The following configuration statement instructs `maidag' to use this
query for retrieving the user quota:

     quota-query "SELECT quota "
                 "FROM mailbox_quota "
                 "WHERE user_name IN ('${user}','00DEFAULT') "
                 "ORDER BY user_name DESC";

3.11.5 Maidag Scripting
-----------------------

`Maidag' can use global or per-user "mail filters" to decide whether to
deliver the message, and where to deliver it.  As of Mailutils version
2.99.98, such mail filters may be written in the following languages:

   * Sieve *Note Sieve Language::.

   * Scheme

   * Python

   Mail filters to use are specified using `script' configuration
statement.  The following meta-symbols can be used in its argument:

~
%h
     Expands to the recipient home directory.

%u
     Expands to the recipient user name.

   By default, a filename extension decide which scripting language will
be used.  User can alter the choice using `language' configuration
statement.  For example:

     language "python"
     script "~/.maidag-py-filter"

* Menu:

* Sieve Maidag Filters::
* Scheme Maidag Filters::
* Python Maidag Filters::


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Sieve Maidag Filters,  Next: Scheme Maidag Filters,  Up: Maidag Scripting

3.11.5.1 Sieve Maidag Filters
.............................

The file name of the Sieve filter to use is specified using `script'
configuration statement.  For example, the following configuration
statement:

     script "~/.maidag.sv"

instructs `maidag' to use file `.maidag.sv' in the recipient home
directory as a Sieve filter.

   Normal message delivery is attempted if execution of the Sieve code
ended with `keep' action (either implicit or explicit).

   Other Sieve actions are executed as described in *note Actions::.
For example, to deliver message to another mailbox, use the `fileinto'
action.

   Any modifications to headers or body of the message performed by the
Sieve code will be visible in the delivered message.

3.11.5.2 Scheme Maidag Filters
..............................

The file name of the Scheme mail filter is specified using `script'
configuration statement.  For example, the following configuration
statement:

     script "~/.maidag.scm"

instructs `maidag' to use file `.maidag.scm' in the recipient home
directory as a Scheme filter.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Python Maidag Filters,  Prev: Scheme Maidag Filters,  Up: Maidag Scripting

3.11.5.3 Python Maidag Filters
..............................

The file name of the Python mail filter is specified using `script'
configuration statement.  For example, the following configuration
statement:

     script "~/.maidag.py"

instructs `maidag' to use file `.maidag.py' in the recipient home
directory as a Python filter.

3.11.6 Forwarding
-----------------

"Forward file" is a special file in the user's home directory that
contains the email address of the mailbox where the user wants to
forward his mail.  Normally, forward files are processed by MTA.
However, there are some MTA that lack this feature.  One of them is
MeTA1.

   `Maidag' provides a forwarding feature that is useful to compensate
the lack of it.

   Name of the forward file is given using `forward-file' configuration
statement.  A common usage is:

     forward-file .forward;

   The forward file is always searched in the recipient home directory.

   Before actually using the file, a number of safety checks are
performed on it.  If the file fails to pass one of these checks, no
forwarding is performed and the message is delivered as usual.  These
checks can be configured using `forward-file-checks' statement.  Its
argument is a list of the following keywords:

groupwritablefile
file_iwgrp
     The file must not be group writable.

worldwritablefile
file_iwoth
     The file must not be world writable.

linkedfileinwritabledir
link
     The file cannot be a symlink in a writable directory.

fileingroupwritabledir
dir_iwgrp
     The file cannot reside in a group writable directory.

fileinworldwritabledir
dir_iwoth
     The file cannot reside in a world writable directory.

all
     All of the above checks.

   The default is `forward-file-checks all'.

   Each of these keywords may be prefixed by `no' to disable this
particular check.  For example:

     forward-file-checks (nodir_iwoth, nodir_iwgrp);

3.11.7 Delivering Messages to a URL.
------------------------------------

When invoked with the `--url' command line option, `maidag' treats its
arguments as a list of mailbox URLs and attempts to deliver the message
to each of them.

   For example:

     $ maidag --url maildir:///home/smith/Mail


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Remote Mailbox Delivery,  Next: Conf-maidag,  Prev: Url-mode,  Up: maidag

3.11.8 Remote Mailbox Delivery
------------------------------

`Maidag' can be used to deliver mail to remote mailboxes, such as
`imap' or `remote+smtp'.  If the mailbox URL is `remote+smtp' or
`remote+sendmail', the message is actually forwarded over SMTP to the
remote node, so `maidag' acts as a message transfer agent.  For example:

     $ maidag --url remote+smtp://10.10.1.100:24

   This command line will send the message to the machine `10.10.1.100'
using port `24' (private mail system).

   The `remote+prog' mailbox may be of special use.  Delivering to this
mailbox results in invoking the specified command with the given
arguments and passing the message to its standard input.  There are two
ways to specify a `remote+prog' mailbox:

remote+prog://PROGRAM?ARGS
     Here, PROGRAM is the absolute pathname of the program binary, and
     ARGS are its arguments, separated by `&' signs.

|PROGRAM ARGS
     In this notation, ARGS are command line arguments separated by
     white space.

   In both cases, ARGS do not include `argv[0]'.

   The `remote+prog' mailbox may be used, in particular, to implement
mailing lists with MeTA1.

   For example, suppose that the `maidag' configuration contains:

     auth {
       authorization sql:system;
       authentication generic:system;
     }

     sql {
       interface mysql;
       db mail;
       getpwnam "SELECT user as name, mailbox, "
                "'x' as passwd, 500 as uid, 2 as gid, "
                "'/nonexistent' as dir, '/sbin/nologin' as shell "
                "FROM userdb "
                "WHERE user='${user}'";
     }

   Then, the following entries in the `userdb' table implement
<mailman@yourdomain> mailing list:

     mysql> select * from userdb;
     +---------------------+---------------------------------------+
     | user                | mailbox                               |

File: mailutils.info,  Node: mimeview,  Next: pop3d,  Prev: maidag,  Up: Programs

3.12 mimeview
=============

For each file given in its command line, `mimeview' attempts to
autodetect its type and invoke an appropriate file viewer.

   To detect the file type, `mimeview' uses `mime.types' file.  This
file is a part of Common UNIX Printing System, *note mime.types:
(mime.types(5))mime.types.  By default `mimeview' searches for
`mime.types' in `$prefix/etc/cups/'(1), however its exact location can
be specified at runtime as well (see `--mimetypes' below).

   Once file MIME type is successfully determined, `mimeview' consults
`mailcap' files in order to determine how to display the file.  It does
so essentially in the same manner as `metamail' utility, i.e., it scans
all files specified in `METAMAIL' environment variable until it finds
an entry describing the desired file format or until the list of files
is exhausted.  If `METAMAIL' variable is not set, `mimeview' uses the
following default path instead:

     $HOME/.mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap:\
      /usr/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:\
      /etc/mail/mailcap:/usr/public/lib/mailcap

* Menu:

* Mimeview Invocation::
* Mimeview Config::

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The exact location is determined at configuration time by
setting environment variable `DEFAULT_CUPS_CONFDIR'.  On most sites
running

     ./configure DEFAULT_CUPS_CONFDIR=/etc/cups

should be recommended.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Mimeview Invocation,  Next: Mimeview Config,  Up: mimeview

3.12.1 Mimeview Invocation
--------------------------

The following table summarizes options specific for `mimeview':

`-a[TYPE-LIST]'
`--no-ask[=TYPE-LIST]'
     By default `mimeview' asks for confirmation before running
     interpreter to view a message.  If this option is used without
     argument, it disables the default behavior for all message types.
     Otherwise, if argument TYPE-LIST is given, it specifies a
     comma-separated list of MIME types for which no questions should be
     asked.  Elements of this list may include shell-style globbing
     patterns, e.g. setting

          --no-ask='text/*,image/jpeg'

     will disable prompting before displaying any textual files, no
     matter what their subtype is, and before displaying files with
     type `image/jpeg'.

     Notice, that when the long form is used, its argument must be
     separated from the option by a single equal sign, as shown in the
     example above.  When the short form (`-a') is used, its argument
     must follow the option immediately, without any intervening
     whitespace, e.g.  `-a'text/*'').

`-d[FLAGS]'
`--debug[=FLAGS]'
     Enables debugging output.  FLAGS is a sequence of characters
     specifying the desired debugging level.  Following characters are
     meaningful in FLAGS:

    g
          Enables debugging of `mime.types' parser

    l
          Enables debugging of `mime.types' lexical analyzer (warning:
          produces _very_ copious output)

    1
          Prints basic information about actions to be executed and
          reports about exit status of executed commands.

    2
          Additionally displays each file name along with its MIME type

    3
          Additionally traces the process of looking up the matching
          entry in `mailcap' files.

    digits from 4 to 9
          The same as 3, currently.

     If FLAGS are not given, the default `9' is assumed.

`--metamail[=FILE]'
     Run `metamail' to display files, instead of using the internal
     mechanisms.  If FILE is specified, it is taken as `metamail'
     command line.

`-h'
`--no-interactive'
`--print'
     This options tells `mimeview' that it should run in
     non-interactive mode.  In this mode prompting is disabled, and the
     normal mailcap `command' field is not executed.  Instead
     `mimeview' will execute the command specified in the `print'
     field.  If there is nothing in the print field, the mailcap entry
     is ignored and the search continues for a matching mailcap entry
     that does have a `print' field.

     Notice, that unlike in `metamail -h', this option does not force
     `mimeview' to send the output to the printer daemon.

     When used with `--metamail' option, this option passes `-h' flag
     to the invocation of `metamail'.

     By default `mimeview' behaves as if given `--no-interactive'
     option whenever its standard input is not a tty device.

`-n'
`--dry-run'
     Do not do anything, just print what would be done.  Implies
     `--debug=1', unless the debugging level is set up explicitly.

`-t FILE'
`--mimetypes FILE'
     Use FILE as `mime.types' file.  If FILE is a directory, use
     `FILE/mime.types'

3.13 POP3 Daemon
================

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

The `pop3d' daemon implements the Post Office Protocol Version 3 server.

   `pop3d' has two operation modes:

Inetd
     The server is started from `/etc/inetd.conf' file:

          pop3  stream tcp nowait  root  /usr/local/sbin/pop3d pop3d

     This is the default operation mode.

Standalone
     The server runs as daemon, forking a child for each new connection.

   The server operation mode is configured using `mode' statement
(*note mode: Server Settings.).

* Login delay::
* Auto-expire::
* Bulletins::
* Conf-pop3d::           Pop3d Configuration
* Command line options::


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Login delay,  Next: Auto-expire,  Up: pop3d

3.13.1 Login delay
------------------

POP3 clients often login frequently to check for new mail.  Each new
connection implies authenticating the user and opening his maildrop and
can be very resource consuming.  To reduce server load, it is possible
to impose a minimum delay between any two consecutive logins.  This is
called `LOGIN-DELAY' capability and is described in RFC 2449.

   As of version 2.99.98, GNU Mailutils `pop3d' allows to set global
login delay, i.e. such enforcement will affect all POP3 users.  If a
user attempts to log in before the specified login delay expires, he
will get the following error message:

     -ERR [LOGIN-DELAY] Attempt to log in within the minimum login delay interval

   The message will be issued after a valid password is entered.  This
prevents this feature from being used by malicious clients for account
harvesting.

   To enable the login delay capability, specify the minimum delay
using `login-delay' configuration statement, e.g.:

     login-delay 60;

   The `pop3d' utility keeps each user's last login time in a special
DBM file, called "login statistics database", so to be able to use this
feature, Mailutils must be compiled with DBM support.  By default, the
login statistics database is called `/var/run/pop3-login.db'.  You can
change its name using `stat-file' configuration statement:

     login-delay 60;
     stat-file /tmp/pop.login.db;

   The login delay facility will be enabled only if `pop3d' is able to
access the statistics database for both reading and writing.  If it is
not, it will report this using `syslog' and start up without login
delay restrictions.  A common error message looks like:

     Unable to open statistics db: Operation not permitted

   You can check whether your `pop3d' uses login delays by connecting
to it and issuing the `CAPA' command.  If login delays are in use,
there response will contain the string `LOGIN-DELAY N', where N is the
actual login delay value.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Auto-expire,  Next: Bulletins,  Prev: Login delay,  Up: pop3d

3.13.2 Auto-expire
------------------

Automatic expiration of messages allows you to limit the period of time
users are permitted to keep their messages on the server.  It is
enabled by `expire' configuration statement:

`expire N;'
     Enable automatic expiration of messages after N days.

   The current implementation works as follows.  When a message is
downloaded by `RETR' or `TOP' command, it is marked with
`X-Expire-Timestamp: N' header, where N is current value of UNIX
timestamp.  The exact expiration mechanism depends on you.  Mailutils
allows you two options:

  1. Expired messages are deleted by `pop3d' upon closing the mailbox.
     You specify this mechanism using `delete-expired' configuration
     statement:

    `delete-expired BOOL;'
          If BOOL is `true', delete expired messages after receiving
          the `QUIT' command.

  2. Expired messages remain in the mailbox after closing it.  The
     system administrator is supposed to run a cron job that purges the
     mailboxes.  Such a cron job can be easily implemented using
     `sieve' from GNU Mailutils and the following script:

          require "timestamp";
          # Replace "5" with the desired expiration period
          if timestamp :before "X-Expire-Timestamp" "now - 5 days"
            {
              discard;
            }

     This script will remove expired messages 5 days after the
     retrieval.  Replace `5' with the desired expiration period and
     make sure it equals the argument to `expire' configuration keyword.

   The statement `expire 0' means the client is not permitted to leave
mail on the server.  It always implies `delete-expired true'.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Bulletins,  Next: Conf-pop3d,  Prev: Auto-expire,  Up: pop3d

3.13.3 Bulletins
----------------

The bulletin feature allows you to send important announcements to all
POP3 users without mailing them.  It works by creating a "bulletin
source mailbox" and sending the announcements to it.

   After a user successfully authenticates, `pop3d' checks the last
"bulletin number" the user receives.  The bulletin number refers to the
number of the bulletin message in the bulletin source mailbox.  If the
latter contains more messages, these are appended to the user mailbox.

   The user last bulletin number can be kept in two places.  First, it
can be stored in file `.popbull' in his home directory.  Secondly, if
Mailutils is compiled with DBM support, the numbers can be kept in a
DBM file, supplied via `bulletin-db' configuration statement.  If both
the database and the `.popbull' file are present, the data from the
database take precedence.

   To enable this feature, use the following configuration statements:

`bulletin-source MBOX'
     Set the URL of the bulletin source mailbox.

`bulletin-db FILE'
     Set the name of the database file to keep last bulletin numbers in.

   The following example instructs `pop3d' to look for the bulletin
messages in MH folder `/var/spool/bull/mbox' and to keep the database
of last delivered bulletin numbers in `/var/spool/bull/numbers.db':

     bulletin-source mh:/var/spool/bull/mbox;
     bulletin-db /var/spool/bull/numbers.db;

GNU `imap4d' is a daemon implementing IMAP4 rev1 protocol for accessing
and handling electronic mail messages on a server.  It can be run
either as a standalone program or from `inetd.conf' file.

3.14.1 Namespace
----------------

GNU `imap4d' supports a notion of "namespaces" defined in RFC 2342.  A
namespace is a set of directories upon which the user has certain
permissions.  It should be understood that these permissions apply only
if the underlying filesystem allows them.

   The three namespaces supported by `imap4d' are:

Personal Namespace
     A namespace that is within the personal scope of the authenticated
     user on a particular connection.  The user has all permissions on
     this namespace.

Other Users' Namespace
     A namespace that consists of mailboxes from the "Personal
     Namespaces" of other users.  The user can read and list mailboxes
     from this namespace.  However, he is not allowed to use `%' and `*'
     wildcards with `LIST' command, that is he can access a mailbox
     only if he knows exactly its location.

Shared Namespace
     A namespace that consists of mailboxes that are intended to be
     shared amongst users and do not exist within a user's Personal
     Namespace.  The user has all permissions on this namespace.

By default, `imap4d' starts with the following namespaces:

Personal Namespace
     The home directory of the user, if exists.

Other Users' Namespace
     Empty

Shared Namespace
     Empty

   _Note_, that this means that by default, a user won't be able to see
or otherwise access mailboxes residing in the directories other than
his own home.

   To change these defaults, use `shared-namespace' and
`other-namespace' configuration statements:

`shared-namespace LIST'
     Set shared namespace.

`other-namespace LIST'
     Set other users' namespace.

   For both statements, the argument is a list of directories that
belong to this namespace, e.g.:

     shared-namespace (/var/spool/mail,/var/mail);

   If during the session the user creates a mailbox within either of
these namespaces, the mode of the mailbox is determined by the
following configuration statements:

`shared-mailbox-mode MODE'
     Set file mode for mailboxes created in shared namespace.

`other-mailbox-mode MODE'
     Set file mode for mailboxes created in other users' namespace.

   In both cases, the argument, MODE is a list of symbolic mode
settings, similar to that used by `chmod'.  It is a list of
comma-separated mode change commands.  Each command begins with a
letter `g', which means set mode bits for file group, or `o', which
means set mode bits for other users (note, that there is no `u'
specifier, since user ownership of his mailbox cannot be changed).
This letter is followed by an `=' (or `+'), and a list of modes to be
set.  This list can contain only two letters: `r' to set read
permission, and `w' to set write permission.

   For example, the following statement sets read and write permissions
for the group:

     shared-namespace-mode g=rw;

 -- Imap4d Conf: login-disabled BOOL
     Disable `LOGIN' command, if BOOL is `true'.

 -- Imap4d Conf: create-home-dir BOOL
     Create nonexistent user home directories.  See also home-dir-mode,
     below.

 -- Imap4d Conf: home-dir-mode MODE
     Set file mode for created user home directories.  Mode is
     specified in octal.

     The default value for MODE is `700' (`drwx------' in `ls' terms).

 -- Imap4d Conf: tls-required BOOL
     Require successful `STARTTLS' command before entering
     authentication phase.

 -- Imap4d Conf: preauth MODE
     Configure PREAUTH mode.  Valid arguments are:

    prog:///PROGRAM-NAME
          `Imap4d' invokes an external program to authenticate the
          connection.  The command line is obtained from the supplied
          string, by expanding the following meta-variables:

         `${client_address}'
               Remote IP address in dotted-quad notation;

         `${client_port}'
               Remote port number;

         `${server_address}'
               Local IP address;

         `${server_port}'
               Local port number.

          If the connection is authenticated, the program should print
          the user name, followed by a newline character, on its
          standard output and exit with code `0'.

          Otherwise, it should exit with a non-zero exit code.

    ident[://:PORT]
          The remote machine is asked about the requester identity
          using the identification protocol (RFC 1413).  Both plaintext
          and DES encrypted replies are understood.  Optional PORT
          specifies the port to use, if it differs from the default
          `113'.  It can be either a decimal port number or a symbolic
          name of a service, listed in `/etc/services'.

    stdio
          PREAUTH mode is enabled automatically if imap4d is started
          from command line in interactive mode (`-i' command line
          option).  The current login name is used as the user name.

 -- Imap4d Conf: preauth-only BOOL
     If BOOL is `true', use only preauth mode.  If unable to setup it,
     disconnect immediately.

 -- Imap4d Conf: ident-keyfile FILE
     Set DES keyfile for decoding encrypted ident responses.  Used with
     `ident://' preauth mode.

 -- Imap4d Conf: ident-encrypt-only BOOL
     Use only encrypted IDENT responses.

3.14.3 Starting `imap4d'
------------------------

`imap4d' may run either in "standalone" or in "inetd" operation modes.
When run in "standalone" mode, the server disconnects from the terminal
and runs as a daemon, forking a child for each new connection.

   The "inetd" mode allows to start the server from `/etc/inetd.conf'
file.  This is the default operation mode.

Command Line Options
--------------------

`-d[NUMBER]'
`--daemon[=NUMBER]'
     Run in standalone mode.  An optional NUMBER specifies the maximum
     number of child processes the daemon is allowed to fork.  When it
     is omitted, it defaults to 20 processes.  _Please note_, that
     there should be no whitespace between the `-d' and its parameter.

`-h'
`--help'
     Display short help message and exit.

`-i'
`--inetd'
     Run in inetd mode.

`--foreground'
     Run in foreground.

`--preauth'
     Start in preauth mode

`--tls[=BOOL]'
     Enable TLS support

`--debug-auth'
     Debug authentication functions.

`-v'
`--version'
     Display program version and exit.

3.15 Comsat Daemon
==================

_Editor's note:_ The information in this node may be obsolete or
otherwise inaccurate.  This message will disappear, once this node
revised.

Comsatd is the server which receives reports of incoming mail and
notifies users, wishing to get this service.  It can be started either
from `inetd.conf' or as a standalone daemon.

* Menu:

* Starting comsatd::       Invocation.
* Configuring comsatd::    Configuration of `comsatd'.
* dot.biffrc::             A per-user configuration file.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Starting comsatd,  Next: Configuring comsatd,  Up: comsatd

3.15.1 Starting `comsatd'
-------------------------

`Comsatd' uses following option groups: See mailbox (*Editor's note:
dangling link*) , See daemon (*Editor's note: dangling link*) , See
logging (*Editor's note: dangling link*) .

`-C FILE'
`--convert-config=FILE'
     Convert the configuration file FILE to the new format.  FILE must
     be a `comsatd' configuration file in Mailutils v. 1.x format.  The
     converted file is printed on the standard output.  For example,
     the following command can be used to convert old `comsatd'
     configuration file to new format:

          $ comsatd --convert-config=/etc/comsatd.conf > /etc/mailutils.d/comsatd

`-d'
`--daemon'
     Run as a standalone daemon.

`-i'
`--inetd'
     The server is started from `/etc/inetd.conf' file:

          comsat dgram  udp wait  root  /usr/sbin/comsatd \
          comsatd -c /etc/comsat.conf

     This is the default operation mode.

`-t'
`--test'
     Test mode.  In this mode, `comsatd' takes two arguments: URL of a
     mailbox and QID of the message from that mailbox, e.g.:

          $ comsatd --test /var/mail/root 34589

3.15.2.1 General Settings
.........................

These statements control the general behavior of the comsat daemon:

 -- Comsatd Conf: max-lines NUMBER
     Set maximum number of message body lines to be output.

 -- Comsatd Conf: allow-biffrc BOOL
     Enable or disable processing of user's `.biffrc' file.  By default,
     it is enabled.

These statements control the way `comsatd' fights possible flooding
attacks.

 -- Comsatd Conf: max-requests NUMBER
     Set maximum number of incoming requests per
     `request-control-interval'.

 -- Comsatd Conf: request-control-interval DURATION
     Set the request control interval.

 -- Comsatd Conf: overflow-delay-time DURATION
     Set initial amount of time to sleep, after the first overflow
     occurs.

 -- Comsatd Conf: overflow-control-interval DURATION
     Set overflow control interval.  If two consecutive overflows happen
     within that interval, the overflow-delay-time is doubled.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: dot.biffrc,  Prev: Configuring comsatd,  Up: comsatd

3.15.3 A per-user Configuration File
------------------------------------

By default, when a notification arrives, `comsatd' prints subject, from
headers and the first five lines from the new message to the user's
tty.  The user is allowed to change this behavior by using his own
configuration file.  This file should be located in the user's home
directory and should be named `.biffrc'.  It must be owned by the user
and have its permissions bits set to 0600. (_Please note_, that the use
of per-user configuration files may be disabled, by specifying
`allow-biffrc no' in the main configuration file, see *note Configuring
comsatd::).

   The `.biffrc' file consists of a series of statements.  Each
statement occupies one line and defines an action to be taken upon
arrival of a new mail.  Very long lines may be split using `\' as the
last character on the line.  As usual, comments may be introduced with
`#' character.

   The actions specified in `.biffrc' file are executed in turn.  The
following actions are defined:

beep
     Produce an audible signal.

echo [-n] STRING [STRING...]
     Output the arguments to the user's terminal device.  If several
     arguments are given they will be output separated by single
     spaces.  The newline character will be printed at the end of the
     output, unless the `-n' option is used.

exec PROG ARGLIST
     Execute program PROG with arguments from ARGLIST.  PROG must be
     specified with absolute pathname.  It may not be a setuid or
     setgid program.

   In the description above, STRING denotes any sequence of characters.
This sequence must be enclosed in a pair of double-quotes, if it
contains whitespace characters.  The `\' character inside a string
starts a C escape sequence.  Following meta-characters may be used in
strings:

$u
     Expands to username

$h
     Expands to hostname

$H{name}
     Expands to value of message header `name'.

$B(C,L)
     Expands to message body.  C and L give maximum number of
     characters and lines in the expansion.  When omitted, they default
     to 400, 5.

Example I
.........

Dump to the user's terminal the contents of `From' and `Subject'
headers followed by at most 5 lines of message body.
     echo "Mail to \a$u@$h\a\n---\n\
     From: $H{from}\n\
     Subject: $H{Subject}\n\
     ---\n\
     $B(,5)\
     ---\n"

The above example can also be written as:
     echo Mail to \a$u@$h\a
     echo ---
     echo From: $H{From}
     echo Subject: $H{Subject}
     echo ---
     echo $B(,5)
     echo ---

Example II
..........

Produce a bell, then pop up the xmessage window on display :0.0 with
the text formatted in the same manner as in the previous example.

     beep
     exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xmessage \
     -display :0.0 -timeout 10 "Mail to $u@$h \n---\n\
     From: $H{from}\n\
     Subject: $H{Subject}\n\
     ---\n\
     $B(,5)\
     ---\n"

File: mailutils.info,  Node: Format String Diffs,  Next: Profile Variable Diffs,  Up: Diffs

3.16.1.1 New and Differing MH Format Specifications
...................................................

 -- MH Format: string decode (string STR)
     Decodes the input string STR as per RFC 2047.  Useful in printing
     `From:', `To:' and `Subject:' headers.

     Notice that, unlike the similar NMH function, `decode' checks the
     value of the global profile variable `Charset' (*note Charset
     variable::) to determine the charset to output the result in.  If
     this variable is not set, `decode' returns its argument without
     any change.  If this variable is set to `auto', `decode' tries to
     determine the charset name from the setting of `LC_ALL' environment
     variable.  Otherwise, the value of `Charset' is taken to be the
     name of the character set.

 -- MH Format: string package ()
     Returns package name (string `mailutils').

 -- MH Format: string package_string ()
     Returns full package string (e.g.  `GNU Mailutils 2.1')

 -- MH Format: string version ()
     Returns mailutils version.

 -- MH Format: string unre (string STR)
     The function removes any leading whitespace and eventual `Re:'
     prefix from its argument.  Useful for creating subjects in reply
     messages:

            %<{subject}Subject: Re: %(unre{subject})\\n%>

 -- MH Format: void reply_regex (string R)
     Sets the regular expression used to recognize reply messages.  The
     argument R should be a POSIX extended regular expression.
     Matching is case insensitive.

     For example, the following invocation

            %(reply_regex ^\(re|aw|ang|odp\)\(\\[[0-9]+\\]\)?:[[:blank:]])

     corresponds to English `Re', Polish `Odp', Norwegian `Aw' or
     German `Ang', optionally followed by a number in brackets, followed
     by colon and any amount of whitespace.  Notice proper quoting of
     the regex metacharacters.

     See also `Reply-Regex' (*note Reply-Regex variable::) and
     `isreply' (*note isreply MH function::) below.


 -- MH Format: boolean isreply ([string STR])
     If STR is not given, the value of `Subject:' header is taken.

     The function returns true if its argument matches the "reply
     subject" regular expression.  This expression is set via the
     global profile variable `Reply-Regex' (*note Reply-Regex
     variable::) or via the format function `reply_regex'.

     This function is useful for creating `Subject:' headers in reply
     messages.  For example, consider the following construction:

          %<{subject}%(lit)%<(isreply)%?\
          (profile reply-prefix)%(concat)%|%(concat Re:)%>\
          %(concat{subject})%(printhdr Subject: )\n%>

     If the `Subject:' header already contained reply prefix, this
     construct leaves it unchanged.  Otherwise it prepends to it the
     value of `Reply-Prefix' profile variable, or, if it is unset, the
     string `Re:'.

     This expression is used in default `replcomps' and
     `replgroupcomps' files.

 -- MH Format: boolean rcpt (`to' | `cc' | `me' | `all')
     This function returns true if the given element is present in the
     recipient mask (as modified by `--cc' or `--nocc' options) and
     false otherwise.  It is used in default formats for `repl' and
     `comp', e.g.:

          %(lit)%<(rcpt to)%(formataddr{to})%>

     Notice that this means that usual `replcomps' file will be ignoring
     `--cc' and `--nocc' options, unless it has been modified as shown
     above.

 -- MH Format: string concat ()
     Appends whitespace + arg to string register.

 -- MH Format: string printhdr (string STR)
     Prints the value of string register, prefixed by STR.  The output
     is formatted as a RFC 822 header, i.e.  it is split at whitespace
     characters nearest to the width boundary and each subsequent
     segment is prefixed with horizontal tabulation.

 -- MH Format: string in_reply_to ()
     Generates the value for `In-reply-to:' header according to RFC
     2822.

 -- MH Format: string references ()
     Generates the value for `References:' header according to RFC 2822.

3.16.1.2 New MH Profile Variables
.................................

 -- Variable: MH Variable string Charset
     Controls the character set in which the components decoded via the
     `decode' (*note decode function::) format function should be
     output.

 -- Variable: MH Variable string Reply-Regex
     Keeps the regular expression used to recognize reply messages.  The
     argument should be a POSIX extended regular expression.  Matching
     is case insensitive.

     For more information, please see *Note reply_regex function::.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Program Diffs,  Prev: Profile Variable Diffs,  Up: Diffs

3.16.1.3 Differences in MH Program Behavior
...........................................

`anno'
     The prompt in interactive mode is `Component name:', instead of
     `Enter component name:' displayed by the RAND `anno'.

     If a `-component field' is not specified and standard input is not
     connected to a terminal, `anno' does not display the prompt before
     reading the component from the standard input.  RAND `anno'
     displays the prompt anyway.

`burst'
     The utility is able to burst both RFC 934 digest messages and MIME
     multipart messages.  It provides two additional command line
     options: `--recurse' and `--length'.

     The `--recurse' option instructs the utility to recursively expand
     the digest.

     The `--length' option can be used to set the minimal encapsulation
     boundary length for RFC 934 digests.  Default length is 1, i.e.
     encountering one dash immediately following a newline triggers
     digest decoding.  It is OK for messages that follow RFC 934
     specification.  However, many user agents do not precisely follow
     it, in particular, they often do not escape lines starting with a
     dash by `- ' sequence.  `Mailman' is one of such agents.  To cope
     with such digests you can set encapsulation boundary length to a
     higher value.  For example, `bounce --length=8' has been found to
     be sufficient for most Mailman-generated digests.

`comp'
     Understands `--build' option.

`fmtdump'
     This command is not provided.  Use `fmtcheck' instead.

`inc'
        * The `--moveto' option.  The `--moveto' option instructs `inc'
          to move messages into another folder after incorporating
          them.  This option has effect only if the `--truncate' option
          has also been specified and the underlying mailbox supports
          the `move' operation.  Currently only `imap' and `imaps'
          mailboxes support it.  For example, the following command
          moves incorporated messages into the `archive' folder:

               inc --file imaps://imap.gmail.com --moveto=archive

          The `moveto' URL parameter can be used instead of this option,
          e.g.:

               inc --file 'imaps://imap.gmail.com;moveto=archive'

        * Multiple sources Mailutils `inc' is able to incorporate
          messages from several source mailboxes. These are specified
          via multiple `-file' options, e.g.:

               inc  -truncate \
                    -file 'imaps://imap.gmail.com;moveto=archived' \
                    -file pops://mail.gnu.org \
                    -file /var/mail/root

        * URL parameters The following additional parameters can be
          used in the mailbox URLs supplied with the `-file' option:

         `moveto=FOLDER'
               Moves incorporated messages into another folder.  This
               was discussed above.

         `nomoveto'
               Disables the previous `--moveto' option.

         `truncate[=BOOL]'
               Controls source mailbox truncation.  If BOOL is not
               given or it is `yes', the mailbox will be truncated
               after successful processing.  If BOOL is `no', the
               source mailbox will not be truncated.

`mhl'
     The `ignores' keyword can be used in variable list.  In that case,
     if its value contains  more than one component name it must be
     enclosed in double-quotes, e.g.:

          leftadjust,compwidth=9,"ignores=msgid,message-id,received"

     The above is equivalent to the following traditional notation:

          leftadjust,compwidth=9
          ignores=msgid,message-id,received

     The `MessageName' component is not yet implemented.

     Interactive prompting is not yet implemented.

     The following format variables are silently ignored: `center',
     `split', `datefield'.

`mhn'
        * New option New option `--compose' forces `mhn' editing mode.
          This is also the default mode.  This differs from the standard
          `mhn', which switches to the editing mode only if no other
          options were given and the input file name coincides with the
          value of `mhdraft' environment variable.

        * Show mode (`--show') If an appropriate
          mhn-show-type[/subtype] was not found, GNU `mhn' prints the
          decoded message content using `moreproc' variable.  Standard
          `mhn' in this case used to print `don't know how to display
          content' diagnostic.

          The default behaviour is to pipe the content to the standard
          input of the mhn-show-type[/subtype] command.  This is
          altered to using a temporary file if the command contains
          `%f' or `%F' escapes.

        * Store mode (`--store') If the `Content-Disposition' header
          contains `filename=', and `mhn' is invoked with `--auto'
          switch, it transforms the file name into the absolute
          notation and uses it only if it lies below the current
          mhn-storage directory.  Standard `mhn' only requires that the
          file name do not begin with `/'.

          Before saving a message part, GNU `mhn' checks if the file
          already exists.  If so, it asks whether the user wishes to
          rewrite it.  This behaviour is disabled when `--quiet' option
          was given.

`mhparam'
     The `--all' mode does not display commented out entries.

`pick'
     The command line syntax `--COMPONENT STRING') is recognized only
     if at least one of the following conditions is met:

        * The word COMPONENT contains at least one capital letter.
          E.g.  `--User-Agent Mailutils'.

        * The word COMPONENT ends with a colon, as in `user-agent:
          Mailutils'.

        * Standard input is not connected to a terminal.

     The GNU syntax for component matching is:

          pick --component FIELD --pattern STRING

     New command line option `--cflags' allows to control the type of
     regular expressions used.  The option must occur right before
     `--pattern' or `--component' option (or one of its aliases, like
     `--cc', `--from', etc.)

     The argument to this option is a string of type specifications:

     B             Use basic regular expressions
     E             Use extended regular expressions
     I             Ignore case
     C             Case sensitive

     Default is `EI'.

     The flags remain in effect until the next occurrence of `--cflags'
     option.

     Sample usage:

          pick --cflag BC --subject '*a string'

     The date comparison options (`--before' and `--after' accept date
     specifications in a wide variety of formats, e.g.:

          pick --after 20030301
          pick --after 2003-03-01
          pick --after 01-mar-2003
          pick --after 2003-mar-01
          pick --before '1 year ago'
          etc...

`prompter'
       1. Prompter attempts to use GNU Readline library, if it is
          installed.  Consequently, arguments to `-erase' and `-kill'
          option must follow GNU style key sequence notation (*note
          keyseq: (readline)Readline Init File Syntax.).

          If `prompter' is built without `readline', it accepts the
          following character notations:

         \NNNN
               Here, N stands for a single octal digit.

         ^CHR
               This notation is translated to the ASCII code `CHR +
               0100'.

       2. Component continuation lines are not required to begin with a
          whitespace.  If leading whitespace is not present, `prompter'
          will add it automatically.

`refile'
       1. Linking messages between folders goes against the logic of
          Mailutils, so `refile' never makes links even if called with
          `--link' option.  The latter is actually a synonym for
          `--copy', which preserves the original message.

       2. The `--preserve' option is not implemented.  It is retained
          for backward compatibility only.

       3. Message specs and folder names may be interspersed.

`repl'
     Understands `--use' option.  Disposition shell provides `use'
     command.

`rmm'
       1. Different behaviour if one of the messages in the list does
          not exist:

          Mailutils `rmm' does not delete any messages.  Standard `rmm'
          in this case deletes all messages preceding the non-existent
          one.

       2. The `rmm' utility will unlink messages, if the `rmmproc'
          profile component has empty value, e.g.:

               rmmproc:

`sortm'
     New option `--numfield' specifies numeric comparison for the given
     field.

     Any number of `--datefield', `--textfield' and `--numfield'
     options may be given, thus allowing to build sort criteria of
     arbitrary complexity.

     The order of `--.*field' options sets the ordering priority.  This
     differs from the behaviour of the standard `sortm', which always
     orders datefield-major, textfield-minor.

     Apart from sorting the mailfolder the following actions may be
     specified:

    `--list'
          List the ordered messages using a format string given by
          `--form' or `--format' option.

    `--dry-run'
          Do not actually sort messages, rather print what would have
          been done.  This is useful for debugging purposes.

File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu invocation syntax,  Next: mu help,  Up: mu

3.17.1 Invocation Syntax
------------------------

`Mu' is a command line tool.  Its invocation syntax is:

     mu [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]

   where OPTIONS are options that affect the behavior of `mu' as a
whole, COMMAND instructs it what it is to do and ARGS are any arguments
the COMMAND needs in order to be executed.

   The commands are:

2047
     Decodes or encodes email message headers.

acl
     Tests Mailutils access control lists.

cflags
     Shows compiler options needed to compile with Mailutils.

dbm
     Invokes a DBM management tool.

;filter
     Applies a chain of filters to the input.

help
     Displays a terse help summary.

imap
     Invokes an IMAP4 client shell (in development).

info
     Displays information about Mailutils compile-time configuration.

ldflags
     Constructs a `ld'(1) command line for linking a program with
     Mailutils.

logger
     Logs information using Mailutils log facility.

pop
     Invokes a POP3 client shell.

query
     Queries configuration values.

wicket
     Scans wicket for matching URLs


File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu help,  Next: mu info,  Prev: mu invocation syntax,  Up: mu

3.17.2 mu help
--------------

The `mu help' command lists all available options and command names
along with short descriptions of what each of them does.  It is similar
to the `mu --help' option.

   A command name can be supplied as an argument to `help', in which
case it will display a help page for that particular command, e.g.:

     mu help ldflags

   will output help for the `ldflags' command.  It is synonymous to the
`--help' option used with that particular command, e.g.: `mu ldflags
--help'.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu info,  Next: mu cflags,  Prev: mu help,  Up: mu

3.17.3 mu info
--------------

The `mu info' command displays information about Mailutils compile-time
configuration.  In normal form its output lists a single configuration
flag per line, e.g.:

     $ mu info
     VERSION=2.99.93
     SYSCONFDIR=/etc
     MAILSPOOLDIR=/var/mail/
     SCHEME=mbox
     LOG_FACILITY=mail
     IPV6
     USE_LIBPAM
     HAVE_LIBLTDL
     WITH_GDBM
     WITH_GNUTLS
     WITH_GSASL

   A configuration flag can consist either of a single word, indicating
that a particular capability has been enabled at compile time, or of a
keyword/value pair delimited by an equal sign, which indicates a
particular value used by default for that feature.  For example, `IPV6'
means that Mailutils was compiled with support for IPv6, whereas
`SYSCONFDIR=/etc' means that the default place for configuration files
is in `/etc' directory.

   Such short output is convenient for using `mu info' in scripts to
decide whether it is possible to use a given feature.  To assist human
users, the `--verbose' (`-v') option is provided.  It prints a short
description next to each flag:

     $ mu info --verbose
     VERSION=2.99.93           - Version of this package
     SYSCONFDIR=/etc           - System configuration directory
     MAILSPOOLDIR=/var/mail/   - Default mail spool directory
     SCHEME=mbox               - Default mailbox type
     LOG_FACILITY=mail         - Default syslog facility
     IPV6                      - IPv6 support
     USE_LIBPAM                - PAM support
     HAVE_LIBLTDL              - a portable `dlopen' wrapper library
     WITH_GDBM                 - GNU DBM
     WITH_GNUTLS               - TLS support using GNU TLS
     WITH_GSASL                - SASL support using GNU SASL

3.17.4 mu cflags
----------------

The `mu cflags' command shows compiler options needed to compile a C
source with Mailutils.  It is intended for use in configuration scripts
and Makefiles, e.g.:

     CFLAGS=-g -O2 `mu cflags`


File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu ldflags,  Next: mu query,  Prev: mu cflags,  Up: mu

3.17.5 mu ldflags
-----------------

The `mu ldflags' command is a counterpart of `cflags' which is used for
linking.  It constructs a `ld' command line for linking a program with
Mailutils.

   When used without arguments, it outputs `ld' arguments which would
link only with the core Mailutils library `libmailutils', e.g.:

     $ mu ldflags
     -L/usr/local/lib -lmailutils

   This command accepts a number of keywords which allow to select a
particular subset of Mailutils libraries to link with.  In particular,
the argument `all' instructs it to link in all available libraries:

     $ mu ldflags all
     -L/usr/local/lib -lmu_mbox -lmu_mh -lmu_maildir -lmu_imap -lmu_pop \
     -lmu_mailer -lmu_compat -lmailutils -lmu_auth -lgsasl -lgnutls -lgcrypt \
     -lldap -lgnuradius -lpam -ldl

   Other available keywords are:

mbox
     Link in the UNIX mbox format support.

mh
     Link in the MH format support.

maildir
     Link in the Maildir format support.

imap
     Link in the IMAP protocol support.

pop
     Link in the POP protocol support.

nntp
     Link in the NNTP protocol support.

mailer
     Enable support for mailers.

sieve
     Link in the support for Sieve mail filtering language.

dbm
     Link in the support for DBM databases (libmu_dbm library).

compat
     Provide a compatibility layer for Mailutils 2.x.

auth
     Link in the Mailutils authentication library.

guile
     Provide Guile language bindings.

python
     Provide Python language bindings.

cfg
     Link in the Mailutils configuration library.

argp
     Link in the library for command line parsing.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu query,  Next: mu 2047,  Prev: mu ldflags,  Up: mu

3.17.6 mu query
---------------

The `mu query' command queries values from Mailutils configuration
files.  It takes one or more configuration paths (*note Paths::) as its
arguments.  On output, it displays the values it found, each value on a
separate line.  If the requested value is a block statement it is
displayed in full.  For example, if main configuration file contained:

     logging {
        syslog yes;
        facility mail;
     }

   Then:

     $ mu query .logging.syslog
     syslog yes;
     $ mu query .logging.syslog .logging.facility
     syslog yes;
     facility mail;
     $ mu query .logging
     logging {
       syslog yes;
       facility mail;
     };

   Several command line options allow to modify output format.  The
`--value' option instructs the command to output only values:

     $ mu query --value .logging.syslog
     yes

   The `--path' option instructs it to print full pathnames for each
value:

     $ mu query --path .logging.syslog
     logging.syslog: yes

   The `--program' option instructs `mu' to behave as if it was called
under another program name.  For example, the following command:

     $ mu query --program=pop3d .server.transcript

   will return the value of the `.server.transcript' statement which
the `pop3d' utility would see.

   By default, `mu query' operates on the main configuration file.
Another configuration file can be supplied using the `--file' (`-f')
option:

     $ mu query --file /usr/local/etc/file.conf .pidfile


File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu 2047,  Next: mu filter,  Prev: mu query,  Up: mu

3.17.7 mu 2047
--------------

The `mu 2047' command is a filter for decoding or encoding email
message headers formatted in accordance with RFC 2047 (see
`http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2047.html'.  By default, it operates in
encode mode and assumes the `iso-8859-1' encoding.  If arguments are
supplied in the command line, they are treated as the text to operate
upon.  Otherwise the command acts as a UNIX filter, reading lines from
the standard input and printing results on the standard output.

   For example:

     $ mu 2047 'Keld J/orn Simonsen <keld@dkuug.dk>'
     =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= <keld@dkuug.dk>

   The decode mode can be requested via the `--decode' (`-d') option:

     $ mu 2047 --decode '=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= \
      <keld@dkuug.dk>'
     Keld J/orn Simonsen <keld@dkuug.dk>

   The `--charset' (`-c') option changes the default character set.  It
is meaningful both in decode and in encode modes.  In decode mode it
instructs the utility to convert the output to the given character set.
In encode mode it indicates the encoding of the input data, which will
be reflected in the resulting string:

     $ mu 2047 --charset=utf-8 'Keld J/orn Simonsen <keld@dkuug.dk>'
     =?utf-8?Q?Keld J=C3=B8rn Simonsen <keld@dkuug.dk>?=

   The `--encoding' (`-E') option can be used in encode mode to change
the output encoding.  Valid arguments for this option are:
`quoted-printable' (the default) or `base64'.

   The `--newline' (`-n') option prints an additional newline character
after each line of output.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu filter,  Next: mu acl,  Prev: mu 2047,  Up: mu

3.17.8 mu filter
----------------

The `mu filter' command applies a chain of filters to the input.  The
filters to apply and their arguments are given in the command line.
The full invocation syntax is:

      mu filter [OPTION] FILTER-CHAIN

   The syntax for FILTER-CHAIN in Backus-Naur form follows:

     <filter-chain> ::= <filter> | <filter-chain> "+" <filter>
     <filter> ::= <filter-spec> <ARG>*
     <filter-spec> ::= <WORD> | "~" <WORD>

where <WORD> stands for the filter name and <ARG> represents filter
arguments.  To obtain a list of known filter names, run:

     mu filter --list

   Filters are applied in the order of their appearence, from left to
right and operate in encode mode.  The plus sign has the same meaning
as pipe in shell.  The default mode can be changed using the `--decode'
(`-d') and `--encode' (`-e') options.  Whatever the default mode is, a
`~' character before filter name reverts the mode for that filter alone.

   For example, to encode the contents of file `file.txt' in Base64 run:

     mu filter base64 < file.txt

   To convert it to base64 and use CRLF as line delimiters, run:

     mu filter base64 + crlf < file.txt

   The following command will decode the produced output:

     mu filter --decode crlf + base64

   It can also be written as

     mu filter ~crlf + ~base64

   The following example converts the input from ISO-8859-2 to UTF-8,
quotes eventual `From' occurring at the beginning of a line, encodes
the result in Base64 and changes line delimiters to CRLF:

     mu filter iconv iso-8859-2 utf-8 + from + base64 + crlf

   This final example removes UNIX-style comments from the input and
joins continuation lines:

     mu filter --decode inline-comment -S '#' + linecon

   Such invocation can be useful in shell scripts to facilitate
configuration file processing.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu acl,  Next: mu wicket,  Prev: mu filter,  Up: mu

3.17.9 mu acl
-------------

The `mu acl' command tests Mailutils Access Control Lists.  By default
it reads ACL from the Mailutils configiration file section `acl'.  The
command takes a list of IP addresses as its arguments, applies the ACL
to each of them in turn and prints the result.

   To select the ACL to test, two options are provided.  The `--file'
(`-f') option supplies the name of configuration file to read instead
of the default one.  The `--path' (`-p' option supplies the pathname
(*note Paths::) of the ACL section to use instead of the default
`.acl'.  For example, to test ACL in section `server 213.130.1.232' of
file `/etc/pop3d.conf' use:

     mu acl --file=/etc/pop3d.conf \
            --path=/server="213.130.1.232"/acl ADDRESS

   As an example of its use, consider file `test.conf' with the
following contents:

     acl {
             deny from 10.10.10.1;
             deny from 10.10.1.0/24;
             log from any "Connect from ${address}";
             allow from 10.0.0.0/8;
             allow from 192.168.1.0/24;
             deny from any;
     }

   Then, running `mu acl --file=test.conf 127.0.0.1' you will get:

     Testing 127.0.0.1:
     mu: Connect from 127.0.0.1
     127.0.0.1: deny

   More examples:

     $ mu acl --file=test.conf 127.0.0.1 10.10.10.1 \
              10.10.1.3 10.5.3.1 192.168.1.0 192.168.2.0
     Testing 127.0.0.1:
     mu: Connect from 127.0.0.1
     127.0.0.1: deny
     Testing 10.10.10.1:
     10.10.10.1: deny
     Testing 10.10.1.3:
     10.10.1.3: deny
     Testing 10.5.3.1:
     mu: Connect from 10.5.3.1
     10.5.3.1: accept
     Testing 192.168.1.0:
     mu: Connect from 192.168.1.0
     192.168.1.0: accept
     Testing 192.168.2.0:
     mu: Connect from 192.168.2.0
     192.168.2.0: accept

   The `mu' option `--debug-level' will give you a deeper insight into
the address matching algorithm:

     $ mu --debug-level=acl.trace9 acl --file test.conf 127.0.0.1
     Testing 127.0.0.1:

3.17.10 mu wicket
-----------------

The `mu wicket' command looks up matching URLs in the Mailutils ticket
file (by default, `~/.mu-tickets') and prints them.  The URLs to look
for are supplied in the command line.

   Consider the following ticket file as an example:

     smtp://foo:bar@*
     smtp://bar:baz@gnu.org
     *://baz:qux@*
     *://quux:bar@gnu.org

   Now, running `mu wicket smtp://bar@gnu.org' will show:

     smtp://bar@gnu.org: /home/USER/.mu-tickets:2

(where USER is your login name).  This means that this URL matches the
line 2 in your `.mu-tickets' file.  The `wicket' command does not show
the actual matching line to avoid revealing eventual security-sensitive
information.  You can instruct it to do so using the `--verbose' (`-v')
option:

     $ mu wicket -v smtp://bar@gnu.org
     smtp://bar@gnu.org: /home/USER/.mu-tickets:2: smtp://bar:***@gnu.org

   As you see, even in that case the tool hides the actual password part
by replacing it with three asteriscs.  If you are working in a secure
environment, you can tell `mu wicket' to show passwords as well, by
supplying the `-v' option twice.

   A counterpart of `--verbose' is the `--quite' (`-q') option, which
instructs `wicket' to suppress any output, excepting error messages.
This can be used in scripts, which analyze the `mu wicket' exit code to
alter the control flow.

   The `mu wicket' tool exits with code 0 if all URLs were matched and
with code 1 if some of them were not matched in the ticket file.  If an
error occurred, the code 2 is returned.

3.17.11 mu dbm
--------------

The `mu dbm' tool manages DBM files using `libmu_dbm' The invocation
syntax is:

     mu dbm SUBCOMMAND [OPTIONS] FILE [KEYS]
   or
     mu dbm [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND FILE [KEYS]

where SUBCOMMAND selects the operation mode, OPTIONS modify the tool
behavior and FILE specifies the DBM file to operate upon.  Some
COMMANDs allow for optional KEYS to be specified.

   The FILE argument can be either a DBM file name or a Database URL.

File: mailutils.info,  Node: Create a Database,  Next: Add Records to a Database,  Up: mu dbm

3.17.11.1 Create a Database
...........................

The `create' subcommand and its synonym `load' instruct the tool to
create a new database:

     mu dbm create file.db

   If the argument file already exists, it will be truncated prior to
adding new records to it.

   The data to populate the database with are read from the standard
input.  The `mu dbm' command supports several formats for these data,
which are discussed later.  In the simplest case (a so called `format
0.0') each input line must consist of two fields separated by any
amount of whitespace.  The first field is treated as a key and the
second one as the corresponding value.

   The usual way to read data from a file is, of course, by redirecting
the file to the standard input as in:

     mu dbm create file.db < input.txt

   There is also a special option for that purpose: `--file' (`-f').
Thus, the following command is equivalent to the one above:

     mu dbm create --file input.txt file.db

   The `--file' option has the advantage that it allows, in conjunction
with another options, for copying input file metadata (owner UID, GID
and file mode) to the created database.  For example, the following
command ensures that the created database file will have the same
metadata as the input file:

     mu dbm create --file input.txt --copy-permissions file.db

   The `--copy-permissions' (`-P') option is the one that does the job.

   There are also other ways to control mode and ownership of the
created database, which are described below.

   More advanced dump formats (e.g.  `version 1.0' format) carry
additional information about the file, including its original name,
ownership and mode.  If input is in one of these formats, the file name
argument becomes optional.  If it is not supplied, the name stored in
the input stream will be used.  For example, supposing that the file
`users.dump' is in format 1.0, the following command suffices to
restore the original filename, ownership, mode and, of course, data:

     mu dbm create --file users.dump


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Add Records to a Database,  Next: Delete Records,  Prev: Create a Database,  Up: mu dbm

3.17.11.2 Add Records to a Database
...................................

The `add' subcommand adds records to a database.  Records are read from
the standard input and must be formatted as for `create':

     mu dbm add file.db

   If the argument file does not exist, it will be created.

   Adding a record with a key which is already present in the database
produces an error.  To replace existing records, use the `replace'
subcommand instead.

   The same options that affect the behavior of `create' apply to `add'
and `replace' as well, e.g.:

     mu dbm replace --file input.txt --copy-permissions file.db


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Delete Records,  Next: List the Database,  Prev: Add Records to a Database,  Up: mu dbm

3.17.11.3 Delete Records
........................

To delete records, use the `delete' subcommand.  It reads a list of
keys to delete to be specified as arguments in the command line:

     mu dbm delete file.db foo bar

   The command above will delete from `file.db' records with keys `foo'
and `bar'.

   It is not an error to attempt to delete a key that does not exist in
the database, although such use will produce a warning message.

   By default, keys are matched literally.  It is also possible to use
various pattern matching techniques, depending on the option specified.

   The `--glob' (`-G') option instructs the tool to use UNIX globbing
pattern matching.  For example, the command below will delete all keys
starting with `foo' and ending with a decimal digit:

     mu dbm delete file.db 'foo*[0-9]'

(note the quoting necessary to prevent shell from interpreting the
metacharacters itself).

   Another option, `--regex' (`-R') instructs `mu' to treat supplied
keys as extended regular expressions:

     mu dbm delete --regex file.db 'foo.*[0-9]{1,3}'

   Both options are affected by the `--ignore-case' (`-i') option,
which turns on case-insensitive matching.

   Using pattern matching to delete records can be a risky operation as
selecting a wrong pattern will lead to removing wrong records.  It is
recommended to first use the list mode described below to verify that
the patterns match the right keys.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: List the Database,  Next: Dump the Database,  Prev: Delete Records,  Up: mu dbm

3.17.11.4 List the Database
...........................

The `list' command lists the content of the database:

     mu dbm list file.db

   By default, entire content is listed on the standard output.

   If supplied more than one command line argument, this mode treats the
rest of arguments after the database file name as the keys to look for
and lists only records with these keys:

     $ mu dbm list file.db foo bar
     foo 1
     bar 56

   The `--glob' and `--regex' options instruct the tool to use UNIX
globbing or extended regular expression matching, correspondingly.
These were described in detail above.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Dump the Database,  Next: Dump Formats,  Prev: List the Database,  Up: mu dbm

3.17.11.5
.........

The `dump' subcommand dumps the database to the standard output in a
format suitable for backup or sending over the network (a version 1.0
format).

     mu dbm dump file.db < file.dump

   The produced file is suitable for input to the `create' (`load')
command.  Among other uses, it provides an easy way to convert
databases between various formats supported by Mailutils.  For example
this is how to convert the database file `file.db' to the GDBM database
`new.db':

     mu dbm dump file.db | mu dbm create gdbm://new.db

   Both `list' and `dump' subcommands share the same set of options.
In fact, they are pretty similar, except that use different defaults.
The `list' subcommand is designed to produce a human-readable output,
whereas the dump subcommand is oriented towards backup purposes.

3.17.11.6 Dump Formats
......................

As of version 2.99.98, `mu dbm' supports two formats for dumping DBM
databases.  Both formats are line-oriented.  Comments are introduced
with a sharp (`#') sign in the column 0 of a line, followed by at least
one white space character (space or tab).  Sharp sign followed by a
colon (`#:') introduces a "paragmatic comment", which carries some
additional information to the loader.

   The "version 0.0" format is suitable for databases whose records
contain only ASCII data.  In this format, each record occupies a
separate line, which consists of the key and value separated by a
single TAB character.  Empty lines are ignored.  For example:

     $ mu list /etc/mail/users.db
     root    guessme
     smith   pAssword
     qed     fooBar

   The output in version 0.0 format is human readable and can be used as
input to the popauth utility (see popauth (*Editor's note: dangling
link*) .  However, version 0.0 has serious drawbacks.  First of all, it
is not suitable for databases that contain binary data.  Secondly, it
cannot properly handle keys beginning with a sharp sign or containing
TAB.  The version 1.0 format is free from these drawbacks.

   The "version 1.0" dump format begins with a "header" containing
important information about the file, such as its file name, ownership
and file mode.  This information is stored in pragmatic comments and
allows `mu dbm load' to easily recreate an exact copy of the file.  The
following comments are defined:

#:version=1.0
     Indicates that the data that follow are in version 1.0 format.

#:filename=S
     Original database file name, without directory parts.

#:uid=N
     Owner UID.

#:user=S
     Owner name.

#:gid=N
     Owner GID

#:group=S
     Owner group name.

#:mode=O
     File mode in octal

   Following this header are actual data.  Each record is output in two
parts: key and value.  Each part begins with a `#:len=N' construct on a
line by itself, where N is the length of the data in decimal.  This
line is followed by one or more lines of the actual data, encoded in
base64.  The data are formatted so that each line does not exceed 76
bytes in length (not counting the terminating newline).  An example of
this format follows:

     # Database dump file created by GNU Mailutils 2.99.93 on
     # Tue Nov  1 13:28:03 2011
     #:version=1.0
     #:file=users.db
     #:uid=0,user=root,gid=25,group=mail,mode=640
     #:len=6
     c21pdGgA
     #:len=9
     cEFzc3dvcmQA
     #:len=5
     cm9vdAA=
     #:len=8
     Z3Vlc3NtZQA=
     #:len=4
     cWVkAA==
     #:len=7

3.17.12 mu logger
-----------------

The `mu logger' tool logs information using Mailutils log facility.

   Syntax:

     mu logger [OPTIONS] [MESSAGE]

   The MESSAGE argument, if supplied, gives the text to log.  If not
supplied, the utility reads lines of text from standard input or a file
(if the `--file' option is given) and sends them to log:

     # Send text to log
     $ mu logger I am here
     # Log each line from file.txt
     $ mu logger --file file.txt
     # Read stdin and log it:
     $ mu logger

   The default logging channel is bound to standard error.  To bind it
to syslog, use the `--syslog' command line option.  In that case `mu'
uses facility `user' and priority `err'.  You can change this by using
the `--priority' (`-p') option.  Its argument is either a syslog
facility name or facility and severity names separated by a dot.  For
example, the following invocation will use facility `auth', severity
`info':

     mu logger --priority auth.info

   The syslog tag can be set using the `--tag' (`-t') option:

     mu logger --tag myprog

   The default tag is `mu-logger'.

   The `--severity' (`-s') option sets the Mailutils severity level.
Its argument can be any of the following: `debug', `info', `notice',
`warning', `error', `crit', `alert', `emerg'.

   Finally, the `--locus' (`-l') option binds log messages to a
location in a file.  Its argument has the following syntax:

     FILE:LINE[:COL]

where FILE is the file name, LINE is the line number and optional COL
is the column number in that file.

   For example, the following invocation:

     mu logger --locus mailutils.rc:34 Suspicious statement

   will send the following to the log:

     mu-logger: mailutils.rc:34: Suspicious statement


File: mailutils.info,  Node: mu pop,  Next: mu imap,  Prev: mu logger,  Up: mu

3.17.13 mu pop
--------------

The `mu pop' command invokes an interactive POP3 client shell.  It
reads commands from the standard input, executes them and displays the
results on the standard output.  If the standard input is connected to
a terminal, the readline and history facilities are enabled (provided
that Mailutils is configured with GNU Readline).

   The `mu pop' commands form two major groups.  POP3 protocol commands
interact with the remote POP3 server and display responses obtained
from it.  These commands are named after their POP3 equivalents.
Another group, "internal commands", are used to configure the shell
itself.

POP protocol commands
.....................

connect [-tls] HOSTNAME [PORT]
     Open connection to HOSTNAME.  If the `-tls' option is given, TLS
     encryption (also known as POPS protocol) will be used.  If PORT
     argument is not given, the command uses port 110 for a plain POP
     connection or 995 for POPS (if `-tls' is given).

stls
     Start TLS negotiation.  This command is valid only after successful
     unencrypted connection has been initiated (using `connect' without
     `-tls' argument).

user NAME
     Send user name to the server.  The `pass' command must follow.

pass [PASSWORD]
     Send password.  This command is valid only after `user'.  If the
     PASSWORD argument is omitted, the shell will ask you to enter it.
     While entering, both echoing and history recording will be
     disabled.  Use this to avoid compromising your password.

apop USER [PASSWORD]
     Authenticate with APOP.   If the PASSWORD argument is omitted, you
     will be asked to supply it.  While entering, both echoing and
     history recording will be disabled.

capa [-reread] [NAME...]
     List server capabilities.  Any number of arguments is accepted.
     If given, the shell will display only the named capabilities,
     otherwise it displays entire list.  By default `capa' reuses the
     response of its previous invocation (if there was any), instead of
     resending the `CAPA' command to the server.  To force it do so,
     use the `-reread' option.

noop
     Send a `NOOP' ("no operation") command to the server.

stat
     Get the mailbox size and number of messages in it.

uidl [NUMBER]
     Shows unique message identifiers.  Without arguments, shows
     identifiers for each message in the mailbox.  If NUMBER is given,
     the command returns the UIDL of that particular message only.

list [NUMBER]
     Lists messages.  See above for the meaning of NUMBER.  Each line
     of the produced listing contains describes a single message and
     contains at least the message number and size in bytes.  Depending
     on the POP3 server implementation, additional fields may be
     present.  For example, Mailutils `pop3d' can also output number of
     lines in the message in the additional third field.

retr NUMBER
     Retrieve a message.

top MSGNO [NUMBER]
     Display message headers and first NUMBER (default 5) of lines of
     its body.

dele NUMBER
     Mark message for deletion.

rset
     Remove deletion marks.

quit
     Quit pop3 session.

disconnect
     Close existing connection.

Internal commands
.................

verbose [on|off|mask|unmask] [secure [payload]]
     Control output verbosity.  Without arguments the `verbose' command
     shows current settings.

     The argument `off' (the default) turns off all additional output.
     The `verbose on' command enables POP3 protocol tracing output.
     Additional arguments can be used to provide more verbosity.  The
     `secure' argument enables display of user passwords in the trace
     output and the `payload' argument enables showing payload data
     (e.g. response body sent in the reply to `RETR' command, etc.)
     Thus, the full diagnostics output is obtained by

          verbose on secure payload

     The `mask' and `unmask' arguments allow to disable and enable such
     additional verbosity.  For example, supposing the command above is
     in action, the following command will suppress the display of user
     passwords in the traces:

          verbose mask secure

     Similarly, `verbose unmask secure' will turn it back again.

prompt STRING
     Set command prompt.  The argument can contain "variable
     references" in any of the following forms:

          $NAME
          ${NAME}

     where NAME is the variable name.  Such references are expanded to
     the actual value of the variable at the time of expansion.  The
     following variables are defined:

     Variable                    Expansion
     --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     user                        Login name of the authenticated POP3
                                 user.  If the session is not
                                 authenticated yet, expands to
                                 `[nouser]'.
     host                        Name of the remote host, or `[nohost]'
                                 if no connection is established.
     program-name                Name of the program, as typed on the
                                 command line to invoke it.
     canonical-program-name      `mu'
     package                     `Mailutils'
     version                     Mailutils version number (2.99.98)
     status                      Session status.  One of: `disconnected',
                                 `connected' or `logged in'.

     For example:

          prompt "[${user}@$host "

     Notice the use of quotes to include the space character in the
     prompt.

exit
     Exit the program.

help [COMMAND]
? [COMMAND]
     Without arguments displays a list of commands with possible
     arguments and short descriptions.

     With one argument, displays a terse description for the given
     COMMAND.

5.1 Lexical Structure
=====================

Whitespace and Comments
-----------------------

Comments are semantically equivalent to whitespace and can be used
anyplace that whitespace is (with one exception in multi-line strings,
as described below).

   There are two kinds of comments: hash comments, that begin with a
`#' character that is not contained within a string and continue until
the next newline, and C-style or bracketed comments, that are delimited
by `/*' and `*/' tokens.  The bracketed comments may span multiple
lines.  E.g.:

     if size :over 100K
       { # this is a comment
         discard;
       }

     if size :over 100K
       { /* this is a comment
            this is still a comment */ discard /* this is a comment again
          */ ;
       }

   Like in C, bracketed comments do not nest.

Lexical Tokens
--------------

The basic lexical entities are "identifiers" and "literals".

   An "identifier" is a sequence of letters, digits and underscores,
that begins with a letter or underscore.  For example, `header' and
`check_822_again' are valid identifiers, whereas `1st' is not.  A
special form of identifier is "tag": it is an identifier prefixed with
a colon (`:'), e.g.: `:comparator'.

   A "literal" is a data that is not executed, merely evaluated "as
is", to be used as arguments to commands.  There are four kinds of
literals:

   * Number 

     "Numbers" are given as ordinary unsigned decimal numbers.  An
     optional suffix may be used to indicate a multiple of a power of
     two.  The suffixes are: `K' specifying "kibi-", or 1,024 (2^10)
     times the value of the number; `M' specifying "mebi-", or 1,048,576
     (2^20) times the value of the number; and `G' specifying "tebi-",
     or 1,073,741,824 (2^30) times the value of the number.

     The numbers have 32 bits of magnitude.

   * String A "string" is any sequence of characters enclosed in double
     quotes (`"').  A string cannot contain newlines and double quote
     characters.  This limitation will disappear in future releases.

   * Multiline Strings A "multiline string" is used to represent large
     blocks of text with embedded newlines and special characters.  It
     starts with the keyword `text:' followed by a newline and ends
     with a dot (`.') on a newline by itself.  Any characters between
     these two markers are taken verbatim.  For example:

          text:
          ** This is an automatic response from my message **
          ** filtering program.                            **

          I can not attend your message right now.  However it
          will be saved, and I will read it as soon as I am back.

          Regards,
          Fred
          .

     Notice that a hashed comment or whitespace may occur between
     `text:' and the newline.  However, when used inside the multiline
     string a hash sign looses its special meaning (except in one case,
     see below) and is taken as is, as well as bracketed comment
     delimiters.  In other words, no comments are allowed within a
     multiline string.  E.g.:

          text: # This is a comment

          Sample text
          # This line is taken verbatim
          /* And this line too */
          .

     The only exception to this rule is that preprocessor `include'
     statement is expanded as usual when found within a multiline string
     (*note Preprocessor::), e.g.:

          text:
          #include <myresponse.txt>
          .

     This results in the contents of file `myresponse.txt' being read
     and interpreted as the contents of the multiline string.

     GNU libmu_sieve extends the described syntax as follows.  If the
     keyword `text:' is immediately followed by a dash (`-'), then all
     leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line
     containing delimiter (`.').  This allows multiline strings within
     scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.

     Furthermore, if the `text:' (optionally followed by `-') is
     immediately followed by a word, this word will be used as ending
     delimiter of multiline string instead of the default dot.  For
     example:

          if header "from" "me@example.com"
            {
              reject text:-EOT
                  I do not accept messages from
                  this address.
                  .
                  .
                  EOT
               # Notice that this the multiline string ends here.
               # The single dots above will be part of it.
              ;
            }

   * String Lists 

     A "string list" is a comma-delimited list of quoted strings,
     enclosed in a pair of square brackets, e.g.:

          ["me@example.com", "me00@landru.example.edu"]

     For convenience, in any context where a list of strings is
     appropriate, a single string is allowed without being a member of
     a list: it is equivalent to a list with a single member.  For
     example, the following two statements are equivalent:

          exists "To";
          exists ["To"];

5.2 Syntax
==========

Being designed for the sole purpose of filtering mail, Sieve has a very
simple syntax.

* Menu:

* Commands::
* Actions Described::
* Control Flow::
* Tests and Conditions::


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Commands,  Next: Actions Described,  Up: Syntax

5.2.1 Commands
--------------

The basic syntax element is a "command".  It is defined as follows:

     COMMAND-NAME [TAGS] ARGS
   where COMMAND-NAME is an identifier representing the name of the
command, TAGS is an optional list of "optional" or "tagged arguments"
and ARGS is a list of "required" or "positional arguments".

   Positional arguments are literals delimited with whitespace.  They
provide the command with the information necessary to its proper
functioning.  Each command has a fixed number of positional arguments.
It is an error to supply more arguments to the command or to give it
fewer arguments than it accepts.

   Optional arguments allow to modify the behaviour of the command, like
command line options in UNIX do.  They are a list of "tags" (*note
Lexical Structure::) separated by whitespace.  An optional argument may
have at most one parameter.

   Each command understands a set of optional arguments.  Supplying it
tags that it does not understand results in an error.

   For example, consider the following command

     header :mime :comparator "i;octet" ["to", "from"] "bug-mailutils@gnu.org"

Here, given that `header' takes two positional arguments: `header' is
command name, the list `["to", "from"]' is first positional argument
and the string `"bug-mailutils@gnu.org"' is second positional argument.
There are two optional arguments: `:mime' and `:comparator'.  The
latter has a string `"i;octet"' as its parameter.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Actions Described,  Next: Control Flow,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Syntax

5.2.2 Actions Described
-----------------------

An "action" is a Sieve command that performs some operation over a
message.  Actions do the main job in any Sieve program.  Syntactically,
an action is a command terminated with semicolon, e.g.:

     keep;

     fileinto "mbox";

   GNU Sieve provides the full set of actions described in RFC 3028.
It also allows to extend this set using loadable actions.  *Note
Actions::, for detailed discussion of actions.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Control Flow,  Next: Tests and Conditions,  Prev: Actions Described,  Up: Syntax

5.2.3 Control Flow
------------------

The only control flow statement Sieve has is `if' statement.  In its
simplest form it is:

     if `condition' { ... }

   The effect of this statement is that the sequence of actions between
the curly braces is executed only if the `condition' evaluates to
`true'.

   A more elaborate form of this statement allows to execute two
different sets of actions depending on whether the condition is true or
not:

     if `condition' { ... } else { ... }

   The most advanced form of the "if" statement allows to select an
action depending on what condition from the set of conditions is met.

     if `cond1' { ... } elsif `cond2' { ... } else { ... }

   There may be any number of "elsif" branches in an "if" statement.
However it may have at most one "else" branch.  Notes for C programmers:

  1. The braces surrounding each branch of an "if" statement are
     required.

  2. The "else if" construct is disallowed.  Use "elsif" keyword
     instead.

   Here's an example of "if" statement:

     if header :contains "from" "coyote"
       {
         discard;
       }
     elsif header :contains ["subject"] ["$$$"]
       {
         discard;
       }
     else
       {
         fileinto "INBOX";
       }

   The following section describes in detail conditions used in "if"
statements.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: Tests and Conditions,  Prev: Control Flow,  Up: Syntax

5.2.4 Tests and Conditions
--------------------------

"Tests" are Sieve commands that return boolean value.  E.g. the test

     header :contains "from" "coyote"

returns true only if the header "From" of the current message contains
substring "coyote".

   The tests shipped with the GNU Sieve are described in *note Tests::.

   "Condition" is a Sieve expression that evaluates to `true' or
`false'.  In its simplest form, condition is just a Sieve test.

   To reverse the sense of a condition use keyword `not', e.g.:

     not header :contains "from" "coyote"

   The results of several conditions may be joined together by logical
`and' and `or' operations.  The special form `allof' takes several
tests as its arguments and computes the logical `and' of their results.
Similarly, the form `anyof' performs logical `or' over the results of
its arguments.  E.g.:

     if anyof (not exists ["From", "Date"],
               header :contains "from" "fool@example.edu")
       {
         discard;
       }

5.3 Preprocessor
================

Preprocessor statements are a GNU extension to the Sieve language.  The
syntax for a preprocessor statement is similar to that used in `C'
programming language, i.e. a pound character (`#') followed by a
preprocessor directive and its arguments.  Any amount of whitespace can
be inserted between the `#' and the directive.  Currently implemented
directives are `include' and `searchpath'.

* Menu:

* #include::        Include the contents of a file.
* #searchpath::     Modify the current search path.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: #include,  Next: #searchpath,  Up: Preprocessor

5.3.1 Sieve #include directive
------------------------------

The `#include' directive reads in the contents of the given file.  The
contents is "inserted" into the text being parsed starting at the line
where the directive appears.  The directive takes two forms:

`#include "FILENAME"'
     The FILENAME is taken relative to the current directory.

`#include <FILENAME>"'
     The FILENAME is searched in the list of include directories as
     specified by the `-I' command line options.

   If FILENAME starts with a directory separator character (`/') both
forms have the same effect.


File: mailutils.info,  Node: #searchpath,  Prev: #include,  Up: Preprocessor

5.3.2 Sieve #searchpath directive
---------------------------------

The `#searchpath' directive adds its argument to the list of
directories searched for loadable modules.  It has the same effect as
`library-path' Sieve configuration statement (*note library-path: Sieve
Configuration.).
