@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
GNU Mailutils is a set of libraries and utilities for handling
electronic mail.  It addresses a wide audience and can be of interest
to application developers, casual users and system administrators alike.

It provides programmers with a consistent API allowing them to
handle a variety of different mailbox formats transparently and
without having to delve into complexities of their internal structure.
While doing so, it also provides interfaces that simplify common
programming tasks, such as handling lists, parsing configuration
files, etc.  The philosophy of Mailutils is to have a single and
consistent programming interface for various objects designed to
handle the same task.  It tries to use their similarities to create an
interface that hides their differences and complexities.  This covers
a wide variety of programming tasks: apart from mailbox handling,
Mailutils also contains a unified iterface for work with various DBM
databases and much more.

The utilities built upon these libraries share that same distinctive
feature: no matter what is the internal structure of an object, it is
always handled the same way as other objects that do the same task.
Again, the most common example of this approach are, of course,
mailboxes.  Whatever Mailutils program you use, you can be sure it is
able to handle various mailbox formats.  You even don't have to inform
it about what type a mailbox is: it will do its best to discover it
automatically.

This approach sometimes covers entities which are seldom regarded as
compatible.  For example, using Mailutils it is possible to treat an SMTP
connection as a mailbox opened only for appending new messages.  This
in turn, provides a way for extending the functionality of some
utilities.  As an example, using this concept of mailboxes, the usual
mail delivery agent becomes able to do things usually reserved for
mail transport agents only!

At the core of Mailutils is @file{libmailutils}, a library which
provides an API for accessing a generalized mailbox.  A set of
complementary libraries provide methods for handling particular
mailbox implementations: UNIX mailbox, Maildir, MH, POP3, IMAP4,
even SMTP.  Mailutils offers functions for almost any mail-related
task, such as parsing of messages, email addresses and URLs, handling
MIME messages, listing mail folders, mailcap facilities, extensible
Sieve filtering, access control lists.  It supports various modern
data security and authentication techniques: TLS encryption, SASL and
GSSAPI, to name a few.  Mailutils is able to work with a wide
variety of authorization databases, ranging from traditional system
password database up to RADIUS, SQL and LDAP.

The utilities provided by Mailutils include @command{imap4d} and
@command{pop3d} mail servers, mail reporting utility
@command{comsatd}, general-purpose mail delivery agent
@command{maidag}, mail filtering program @command{sieve}, an implementation
of MH message handling system and much more.

All utilities share the same subset of command line options and use
a unified configuration mechanism, which allows to easily configure
the package as a whole.

@node Book Contents
@section What this Book Contains

@FIXME{This is more a plan on how the document should be structured,
than a description of its actual structure.  However it is:}

  This book addresses a wide audience of both system administrators
and users that aim to use Mailutils programs, and programmers who wish
to use Mailutils libraries in their programs.  Given this audience,
the book is divided in three major parts.

  The first part provides a detailed description of each Mailutils
utility, and advices on how to use them in various situations.  This
part is intended for users and system administrators who are using
Mailutils programs.  If you are not interested in programming using
Mailutils, this is the only part you need to read.

  Subsequent parts address programmers.

  The second part is a tutorial which provides an introduction to
programming techniques for writing mail applications using GNU
Mailutils.

  Finally, the third part contains a complete Mailutils library
reference. 

  This version of the book is not finished.  The places that may
contain inaccurate information carry prominent notices stating so.
For updated versions of the documentation, visit
@uref{http://mailutils.org/manual}.  All material that ends up in this
document is first published in the Mailutils Wiki, available at
@uref{http://mailutils.org/wiki}.  Be sure to visit it for latest
updates.

  If you have any questions that are not answered there, feel free to
ask them at the mailing list @email{bug-mailutils@@gnu.org}. 

@FIXME{Mailutils 3.0 introduced such amount of changes, most of which
being a complete rewrite of the existing codebase, that the library
tutorial and reference became hopelessly obsolete.  It is my deep
conviction that using incorrect documentation is much worse than
having no documentation at all, therefore I have withdrawn the
obsolete parts from this edition of GNU Mailutils manual.  I am doing
my best to document new Mailutils libraries and hope to be able to
re-introduce these parts of the documentation soon.}

@node History
@section A bit of History, and why use this package?
@UNREVISED

This package started off to try and handle large mailbox files more
gracefully then available at that time POP3 servers did.  While it
handles this task, it also allows you to support a variety of
different mailbox formats without any real effort on your part. Also,
if a new format is added at a later date, your program will support
that new format automatically as soon as it is compiled against the
new library.
