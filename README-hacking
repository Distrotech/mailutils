These notes intend to help people working on the CVS version of
this package.

* Requirements

You need the following packages to build the CVS version of GNU
Mailutils.  We do not make any efforts to accommodate older versions of
these packages, so please make sure that you have the latest stable
version. 

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Bison <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>
- Flex <http://flex.sourceforge.net/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>
- Wget <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>
- Gnulib <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib> 
- Git <http://git.or.cz>

* Bootstrapping

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
Mailutils from CVS. The next step is to get other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages: 

1. Change to the source tree directory

   cd mailutils

2. Run

   ./bootstrap 

Once done, proceed as described in the file README (section
INSTALLATION).

Normally you will have to run bootstrap only once. However, if you
intend to hack on Mailutils, you might need to run it again later. In
this case, you will probably want to save some time and bandwidth by
avoiding downloading the same files again. If so, create in GNU Mailutils
root directory the file named `.bootstrap' with the following
contents:

   --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnulib --skip-po

Replace `$HOME/gnulib' with the actual directory where the Gnulib
sources reside.
   
For more information about `bootstrap', run `bootstrap --help'.
