These notes intend to help people working on the Git version of
this package.

* Requirements

You need the following packages to build the Git version of GNU
Mailutils.  We do not make any efforts to accommodate older versions of
these packages, so please make sure that you have the latest stable
version. 

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Bison <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>
- Flex <http://flex.sourceforge.net/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>
- Wget <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>
- Gnulib <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib> 
- Git <http://git.or.cz>

* Bootstrapping

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to clone
Mailutils from Git. The next step is to get other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages: 

1. Change to the source tree directory

   cd mailutils

2. Run

   ./bootstrap 

Once done, proceed as described in the file README (section
INSTALLATION).

Normally you will have to run bootstrap only once. However, if you
intend to hack on Mailutils, you might need to run it again later. In
this case, you will probably want to save some time and bandwidth by
avoiding downloading the same files again. If so, create in GNU Mailutils
root directory the file named `.bootstrap' with the following
contents:

   --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnulib --skip-po

Replace `$HOME/gnulib' with the actual directory where the Gnulib
sources reside.
   
For more information about `bootstrap', run `bootstrap --help'.

* Flowgraphs

To obtain flowgraphs, you need GNU cflow v.1.3 or higher.

To create or update all flowgraphs, run the following command
from the source tree root directory:

  make -f maint.mk

The flowgraphs will be created in the subdirectories and
named COMP.cflow, where COMP is the name of the corresponding
Mailutils component.

To create or update the flowgraph for a given component, change
into this component's subdirectory and run

  make -f ../maint.mk flowgraph

If the component in question has its own maint.mk, run

  make -f maint.mk flowgraph
  
instead.
  
To clean all flowgraphs, run (from the source tree root directory):

  make -f maint.mk maintclean-recursive
