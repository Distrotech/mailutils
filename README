This is the GNU mailutils package
=================================

This package contains a series of useful mail clients, servers, and
libraries.  These are the primary mail utilities of the GNU system.

Specifically, this package contains a pop3 server, and an imap4
server.  It also provides a POSIX `mailx' client, and a collection of
other tools.

The central library is capable of reading mail from an `mbox' mailbox,
as well as off of local or remote pop3 and imap4 servers.

You're welcome to use this library in your own programs, please see
the examples subdirectory or these other applications.  All libraries
are licensd using the GNU LGPL.  The documentation is licensed under
the GNU FDL, and the Sieve library is licensed under a CMU license.
Everything else is licensed using the GNU GPL.

This software is part of the GNU project and belongs to the Free Software 
Foundation.

Why use this package?
=====================

This package started off to try and handle large mailbox files more
gracefully then current pop3 servers did.  While it handles this task,
it also allows you to support a variety of different mailbox formats
without any real effort on your part.  Also, if a new format is added
at a later date, your program will support that new format
automatically as soon as it is compiled against the new library.

This server is also released as part of Debian, so you should expect
it to compile cleanly on all the platforms supported there.

How to install
==============

Please see the INSTALL file in this directory for the generic instructions
on how to use configure. The following short summary describes the mailutils-
specific configuration options:

    --enable-debug

	Compile mailutils with debugging support. This disables compiler
	optimizations and adds debugging information to the binaries.

    --disable-pam

	Do not build PAM support. By default configure will build PAM support
	if the host system supports it. Use this option to suppress this
	behaviour.

    --disable-pthread

	Do not build thread-safe libraries.

    --enable-mysql

	Enable support for authentication via MySQL. Note that depending
	on how your MySQL system is installed, this may require adding
	appropriate directories to the library and include paths, e.g.:

	./configure LIBS='-L/usr/local/mysql/lib' \
                    CPPLAGS='-I/usr/local/mysql/include' --enable-mysql

    --enable-virtual-domains

	Enable support for authentication using virtual mail domains.
	Note that this is also needed if you wish to run testsuites for
	pop3d and imap4d daemons. The following option controls where
	exactly the domain database should be located:

    --with-virtual-pwddir=DIR

	Use DIR instead of $sysconfdir/domain as the location of
	virtual mail domain database.

    --without-readline

	Build 'mail' without readline support.

    --with-gssapi

	Enable GSSAPI authentication. For this to work, you will have
	to have Kerberos V installed on your system.

    --without-guile

	Do not build guile interface library.

    --with-mail-rc=FILE

	Set the location of the system-wide configuration file for mail
	utility. FILE must be an absolute filename specification. Default
	is $sysconfdir/mail.rc

    --with-mail-spool=PATH

	Override the location of the mailspool. The default value depends
	on the system. Usually it is either /var/spool/mail or /var/mail.

    --with-gdbm

	Use GDBM

    --with-db2

	Use Berkeley DB

    --with-ndbm

	Use NDBM

    --with-dbm

	Use old DBM

    --with-log-facility=facility

	Enable logging to the given syslog facility. Default is `mail'.

    --without-included-regex

	Don't compile regex; this is the default on systems with version
	2 of the GNU C library (use with caution on other systems)
