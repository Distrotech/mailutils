This is the GNU Mailutils package
=================================

* Introduction
==============

This package contains a series of useful mail clients, servers, and
libraries. These are the primary mail utilities of the GNU system.

Specifically, this package contains a POP3 server, an IMAP4 server,
and a Sieve mail filter. It also provides a POSIX `mailx' client,
and a collection of other tools.

The central library is capable of reading mail from an `mbox' mailbox,
as well as off of local or remote POP3 and IMAP4 servers.

You're welcome to use this library in your own programs, please see
the examples subdirectory or these other applications. All libraries
are licensed using the GNU LGPL. The documentation is licensed under
the GNU FDL, and everything else is licensed using the GNU GPL. The
complete texts of the corresponding licences are included in the files
COPYING.LESSER, COPYING and doc/texinfo/COPYING.DOC.

This software is part of the GNU Project and belongs to the Free
Software Foundation.

* Why use this package?
=======================

This package started off to try and handle large mailbox files more
gracefully then current POP3 servers did. While it handles this task,
it also allows you to support a variety of different mailbox formats
without any real effort on your part. Also, if a new format is added
at a later date, your program will support that new format
automatically as soon as it is compiled against the new library.

This package is also released as part of Debian, so you should expect
it to compile cleanly on all the platforms supported there.

* How to install
================

Please see the INSTALL file in this directory for the generic instructions
on how to use configure. The following short summary describes the
mailutils-specific configuration options:

    --enable-debug

	Compile Mailutils with debugging support. This disables
	compiler optimizations and adds debugging information to the
	binaries. 

    --disable-pam

	Do not build PAM support. By default configure will build PAM
	support if the host system supports it. Use this option to
	suppress this behaviour.

    --disable-pthread

	Do not build thread-safe libraries.

    --without-fribidi

        Do not include fribidi support, even if libfribidi is present.
		
    --with-sql=MODLIST

        Enable support for authentication using given SQL modules.
        MODLIST is a colon-separated list of SQL modules to use.
        Available modules are 'mysql', 'postgres' and 'odbc'. E.g.,
        to enable all modules: 

		--with-sql=mysql:postgres:odbc


        Note that depending on how your SQL systems are installed,
        this may require adding appropriate directories to the library
        and include paths, e.g.


	./configure LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -L/usr/local/pgsql/lib' \
                    CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/mysql/include \
                             -I/usr/local/pgsql/include' 
    		    --with-sql=mysql:postgres


    --with-mysql

        Equivalent to --with-sql=mysql

        Note that depending on how your MySQL system is installed, this
        may require adding appropriate directories to the library and
        include paths, e.g.:

	./configure LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/mysql/lib' \
                    CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/mysql/include' --with-mysql

    --with-postgres

        Equivalent to --with-sql=postgres 

	You may have to explicitly specify LIBS and CPPFLAGS (see
	above). 

    --with-odbc[={odbc|iodbc}]

        Without arguments or with 'odbc' as its argument it is
        equivalent to --with-sql=odbc.

	--with-odbc=iodbc enables ODBC support via libiodbc.

	You may have to explicitly specify LIBS and CPPFLAGS (see
	above). 

    --enable-mh-utils

        Build a suite of MH utilities. The GNU implementation of MH
        primarily aims to provide an interface between Mailutils' 
        functionality and Emacs, using the mh-e module. 
        For more information, refer to the TODO file in the mh
        subdirectory, and to the section `MH' in the accompanying
	documentation. To access it, run
	`info -f ./doc/texinfo/mailutils.info mh' from the Mailutils
	root directory. After installation, it will become available
	by running `info mailutils mh'.

    --with-mh-bindir=DIR

        By default the MH binaries are installed in
        ${exec_prefix}/bin/mu-mh. To change this, use --with-mh-bindir
        option. If DIR starts with '/' it is taken as an absolute
        path specification, otherwise ${prefix} is prepended to it. 

    --with-virtual-pwddir=DIR

	Use DIR instead of $sysconfdir/domain as the location of
	virtual mail domain database. This option is ignored if
        --disable-virtual-domains is specified.

    --without-readline

	Build 'mail' without readline support.

    --with-gnutls

	Enable the TLS/SSL server-side encryption via GnuTLS
	(a Transport Layer Security Library) in IMAP4/POP3 daemons.

    --with-gsasl

	Enable GNU SASL support (Simple Authentication and Security
	Layer framework). IMAP4d supports this mechanism. This
	requires GSASL version 0.2.3 or newer. 

    --with-gssapi

	Enable GSSAPI authentication. For this to work, you will have
	to have Kerberos V installed on your system.

    --without-guile

	Do not build Guile interface library.

    --with-guiledir[=DIR]

        Specify the directory to install guile modules to. By default
        they are installed in

	  $(prefix)/share/mailutils/$(VERSION)/guile.

	The option --with-guiledir used without argument instructs
	configure script to install modules to the site-wide Guile
	directory, where it is easier to find them. This directory is
	defined as $(guile_pkgdatadir)/site where guile_pkgdatadir is
	the Guile package data directory as returned by `guile-config
	info pkgdatadir'.

	Otherwise, if an argument to the option is given, it specifies
	the absolute file name of the installation directory for Guile
	modules. 
	
    --with-mail-rc=FILE

	Set the location of the system-wide configuration file for mail
	utility. FILE must be an absolute filename specification.
	Default is $sysconfdir/mail.rc

    --with-mail-spool=PATH

	Override the location of the mailspool. The default value
	depends on the system. Usually it is either /var/spool/mail
	or /var/mail. PATH is either an absolute directory name, or a
	valid `mbox' URL in the form:

		mbox:path;type=TYPE;param=N;user=

	This method allows you to use indexed mailspools. For servers
	with a really big number of users this may provide a
	significant speedup in opening the mailbox. 

	TYPE is one of:
		hash       --  The user's mailbox is kept in a subdirectory
			       whose name is determined by hashing first
			       N characters of the user name. There are
			       256 subdirectories named from 00 through FF.
		index	   --  The user's mailbox is located PARAM directories
                               down the `path'. The directories are named
                               after the first N letters of a login name.
			       For example, when N=2 the mailbox for
			       user `smith' is `/var/spool/mail/s/m/smith'.
	        rev-index  --  Same as above, except that the last letters
			       are used, thus the mailbox for `smith' will
	                       be /var/spool/mail/h/t/smith. This may provide
	                       a better average distribution than the `index'
			       method.
	
    --with-log-facility=facility

	Enable logging to the given syslog facility. Default is `mail'.

    --without-included-regex

	Don't compile regex; this is the default on systems with version
	2 of the GNU C library (use with caution on other systems)

    --disable-nls

        Do not use Native Language Support

    --with-included-gettext

       Use the GNU gettext library included in the Mailutils distribution.

    --with-included-argp

        Use the argp library supplied with the package, instead of the
        one from your libc. You will need this option if the libc library
        on your system was compiled without NLS support.

The following options enable DBM support in Mailutils. DBM support is
necessary if you wish to use APOP authentication in POP3 daemon or to
use DBM-based mail box quotas with mail.local.

    --with-gdbm

	Use GNU DBM

    --with-berkeley-db[=ARG]

	Use Berkeley DB. If ARG is not specified, configure will
	attempt to autodetect the database version to use. Unless ARG
	begins with a digit, it is taken as a library name, without
	the `lib' prefix and library type suffix, so that specifying

	    --with-berkeley-db=db-3.1

	instructs configure to use library libdb-3.1.so (or
	libdb-3.1.a).
	Otherwise, if ARG begins with a digit, it is understood as a
	library version number to link to. In this case configure
	assumes a Slackware-like installation layout. Thus, using

	    --with-berkeley-db=3.1

	tells configure to use library libdb-3.1.so (or libdb-3.1.a)
	and header file /usr/include/db31/db.h    

    --with-ndbm

	Use NDBM

        Only one dbm option may be specified. Which one depends on
        the flavor of DBM you are using. GDBM is most common for GNU
        system. 

Use following options to disable support for particular protocols or
features:

    --disable-imap        Disables IMAP protocol support. 
    --disable-pop         Disables POP protocol support. 
    --disable-smtp        Disables support for SMTP mailer. With this
                          option `mail.remote' is not built.
    --disable-sendmail    Disables support for `Sendmail' mailer.
    --disable-mh          Disables support for MH mailbox format.  
    --disable-virtual-domains 
                          Disables support for authentication using
                          virtual mail domains.

Several environment variables affect the configuration. Currently,
the only mailutils-specific variable is DEFAULT_CUPS_CONFDIR. It
sets the location of CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) configuration
directory, which is needed for `mimeview' utility. By default, this
location is $sysconfdir/cups. On most sites, however, it may be
reasonable to set it to /etc/cups, e.g.:

	./configure DEFAULT_CUPS_CONFDIR=/etc/cups ...
