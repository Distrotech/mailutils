This is the GNU mailutils package
=================================

This package contains a POP3 server and a simple replacement for
`/bin/mail'.  An IMAP4 server is being worked on.  These applications
are tied around a central library that handles all mailbox activity
called libmailbox.  If you want to use this in your own programs, see
the examples subdirectory.

The library is licensed under the GNU LGPL.  The documentation is
licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.  All other code is
licensed under the GNU GPL.  See the files COPYING, COPYING.LIB, and
COPYING.FDL for details.

This software is part of the GNU project and belongs to the Free Software 
Foundation.

Why use this package?
=====================

Most POP3 servers load the entire email box into RAM and deal with it
there.  This server, instead, creates an index in RAM of all of the messages
in the mailbox, allowing for quick access.  You can expect this server
to use approx 750kb base code (on IA32) + 32 bytes per message indexed.

How to install
==============
