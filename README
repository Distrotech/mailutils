This is the GNU mailutils package
=================================

This package contains a series of useful mail clients, servers, and
libraries.  These are the primary mail utilities of the GNU system.

Specifically, this package contains a pop3 server, and an imap4
server.  It also provides a POSIX `mailx' client, and a collection of
other tools.

The central library is capable of reading mail from an `mbox' mailbox,
as well as off of local or remote pop3 and imap4 servers.

You're welcome to use this library in your own programs, please see
the examples subdirectory or these other applications.  All libraries
are licensd using the GNU LGPL.  The documentation is licensed under
the GNU FDL, and the Sieve library is licensed under a CMU license.
Everything else is licensed using the GNU GPL.

This software is part of the GNU project and belongs to the Free Software 
Foundation.

Why use this package?
=====================

This package started off to try and handle large mailbox files more
gracefully then current pop3 servers did.  While it handles this task,
it also allows you to support a variety of different mailbox formats
without any real effort on your part.  Also, if a new format is added
at a later date, your program will support that new format
automatically as soon as it is compiled against the new library.

This server is also released as part of Debian, so you should expect
it to compile cleanly on all the platforms supported there.

How to install
