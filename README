This is the GNU mailutils package
=================================

This package contains a POP3 server and a simple replacement for `/bin/mail'.
An IMAP4 server is being worked on.  These applications are tied around a
central library that handles all mailbox activity called libmailbox, which is
LGPLd (See COPYING).  If you want to use this in your own programs, see the
examples subdirectory.

This software is part of the GNU project and belongs to the Free Software 
Foundation.

Why use this package?
=====================

Most POP3 servers load the entire email box into RAM and deal with it
there.  This server, instead, creates an index in RAM of all of the messages
in the mailbox, allowing for quick access.  You can expect this server
to use approx 750kb base code (on IA32) + 32 bytes per message indexed.

How to install
==============

Please see the INSTALL file in this directory.
