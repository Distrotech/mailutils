1999-10-08 Sean 'Shaleh' Perry

	* added showmail.c to examples
	* libmailbox: some minor code cleanups

1999-10-08 Sean 'Shaleh' Perry

	* fixed the "if empty mailbox, return not implemented"
	NB: seems there was a large assumption being made:
	if unixmbox_open() failed, it was because it was not mbox
	this was wrong for many reasons, so on actual "not mbox",
	return EBADMSG.
	Prolly want to come up with a better error, but this works for now
	* more cleaning in the mailbox code
	a) added stat() call -- we can bomb earlier, plus detect if
	passed object is a directory or file
	b) unixmbox_close() free()'s mbox.  This will hamper the use
	when we add support for more mailboxes later.  Need to find
	a solution.  Perhaps a unixmbox_free() call.
	There was also a small leak there -- mbox->name was being left.
	c) To aid checking in unixbox_open(), added checks around fgets call.
	Now properly detects EOF, errors, etc.  This was a large cause of the
	spurious "not implemented" bug.
	d) all of unixmbox_open()'s function calls should now be checked
	NB: need to do the same for rest of file

1999-10-05 Sean 'Shaleh' Perry
