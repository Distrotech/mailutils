Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Oct 1999 18:13:45 -0700

  * added showmail.c to examples
  * libmailbox: some minor code cleanups

Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Oct 1999 01:08:42 -0700

  * fixed the "if empty mailbox, return not implemented"
    NB: seems there was a large assumption being made:
        if unixmbox_open() failed, it was because it was not mbox
    this was wrong for many reasons, so on actual "not mbox", return EBADMSG.
    Prolly want to come up with a better error, but this works for now
  * more cleaning in the mailbox code
    a) added stat() call -- we can bomb earlier, plus detect if passed object
       is a directory or file
    b) unixmbox_close() free()'s mbox.  This will hamper the use when we add
       support for more mailboxes later.  Need to find a solution.  Perhaps
       a unixmbox_free() call.
       There was also a small leak there -- mbox->name was being left.
    c) To aid checking in unixbox_open(), added checks around fgets call.
       Now properly detects EOF, errors, etc.  This was a large cause of the
	   spurious "not implemented" bug.
    d) all of unixmbox_open()'s function calls should now be checked
	   NB: need to do the same for rest of file

Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Oct 1999 22:33:24 -0700

  * removed spurious code in from.c
  * added TODO file

1999-10-07  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@cr499794-a.crdva1.bc.wave.home.com>

	* Makefile.am: Compile libsrc/ first.

	* pop3d/Makefile.am: Link properly with crypt and libmailutils.a
	from libsrc/

	* libsrc/Makefile.am: Produce one library for all functions.
	Do not use libtool for this library, it will never be shared.

	* configure.in: Remove AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.  Export crypt detection
	to Makefiles

Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Oct 1999 18:31:57 -0700

  * included my read_a_line() in examples/

Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Oct 1999 13:55:42 -0700

  * Cleanup some compilation issues
  * changed "w+" to "w" in called to pop3_mainloop():ofile = fdopen()
      why was it called with w+?  It is only ever used for writing.
  * catch EINTR in call to accept() (play nice w/ our UNIX friends)
  * set SO_REUSEADDR on daemon's socket

Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>  Tue,  5 Oct 1999 23:06:33 -0700

  * Added changelog.pl so we can have automated entries
    set CVS_EMAIL=me@here.com and CVS_FULLNAME="Joe Blow"
	usage: changelog.pl "added signal.c" or changelog.pl, an editor will
	then appear (uses $VISUAL and $EDITOR)
	the format is controlled simply via the format call at the end
	and the section of perl code directly above it

Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>  Tue,  5 Oct 1999 17:46:31 -0700
