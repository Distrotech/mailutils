This is the GNU mailutils package.

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet. If you
are taking source from CVS, you will need to have libtool, automake, and
autoconf installed to help contribute. The script autogen.sh is provided to
help autoconfigure mailutils from the cvs src.  See the file 'INSTALL' for
(generic) installation instructions.
